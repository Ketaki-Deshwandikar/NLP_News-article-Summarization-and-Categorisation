NEW DELHI: Devyani Khobrogade, the Indian ambassador to Cambodia , on Sunday grabbed eyeballs on social media by dressing as a ' Khmer Apsara ' to extend New Year wishes to the Cambodian people.The photoshoot showcasing her elegant attire has been circulating widely on the internet.The Indian Embassy in Cambodia shared on X, ""Ambassador Devyani Khobragade has a deep admiration for Khmer culture and tradition.Embracing the spirit of Khmer New Year, she elegantly dressed as a Khmer Apsara, embodying the rich bond of our civilizations. Wishing all our Cambodia friends a joyous Khmer New Year celebration.""Khobrogade, an Indian Foreign Service officer since 1999, has previously served in various Indian missions, including Berlin, New York, Islamabad, and Rome. However, her tenure in New York was marked by controversy when she was arrested on visa fraud charges and accused of providing a ""false statement"".Additionally, allegations surfaced claiming she paid her domestic help below the minimum wage in the United States, which she strongly denied as ""false and baseless."" The charges were later dismissed by a US court, citing diplomatic immunity.The incident strained India-US relations as India refused to waive Khobrogade's diplomatic immunity despite US requests.Consequently, Khobrogade returned to India, and New Delhi responded by downgrading the privileges of certain US diplomats in the country.In retaliation, the US withdrew one of its diplomats from India, marking a tense period in the diplomatic relations between the two nations.","The photoshoot showcasing her elegant attire has been circulating widely on the internet.

The accused officials are said to have diverted illegal gains to themselves and falsified accounts to avoid detection.Sisodia was arrested by CBI on February 26 and ED on March 9 last year in connection with these allegations. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.Earlier, while opposing the regular bail plea of Sisodia, ED said that there was no delay on the part of the prosecution, rather, the delay was caused by the accused persons by filing frivolous applications in the excise policy case, extending his judicial custody till April 18.However, Sisodia's counsel cited in his bail plea a delay in trial. It was argued that trial proceedings are going at a snail's pace.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's request for interim bail to campaign in general elections.

The story of Siachen: How India set up a base at the roof of the world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-story-of-siachen-how-india-set-up-a-base-at-the-roof-of-the-world/articleshow/109280465.cms,"NEW DELHI: The going was extremely tough on the forbidding glacial heights in the initial years. Indian troops had to `survive first and then fight’. But the progressive upgrade of infrastructure, connectivity and medical facilities as well as induction of specialized equipment, heavy-lift helicopters , logistic drones and all-terrain vehicles have all steadily bolstered India’s operational control on the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region.It was on April 13, 1984, that Indian troops occupied almost all the dominating heights from 15,000 to 22,000-feet in the world’s highest and coldest battlefield under `Operation Meghdhoot’ against daunting odds. It pre-empted just by a day or two a similar military operation by Pakistan codenamed `Operation Ababeel’ after a sustained “cartographic aggression” campaign in the unchartered region.“The Indian Army 's control over the Siachen Glacier for the last 40 years has not only been a story of unparalleled valour and determination but also an incredible journey of technological advancements and logistical improvements. One of the world’s most formidable terrains has been transformed into a symbol of indomitable spirit and innovation,” a senior officer said on Saturday.An IAF officer, in turn, said, “Helicopters are the lifeline and the sole link of our troops on the 78-km long glacier with the outside world. Flying in such ruthless terrain and climatic conditions, records of human endurance, flying and technical proficiency are set nearly every day.”The presence of Indian troops on the craggy Saltoro Ridge actually serves as a wedge between China and Pakistan to prevent them from “militarily linking up” to control the Karakoram Pass and threaten Ladakh.The icy barren land, however, has exacted a heavy toll. India has lost over 1,150 soldiers, including almost 40 officers, in the region since April 1984. Over 75% of these casualties have been caused by the severe terrain and climatic conditions, with temperatures even dipping to minus 50 degree Celsius, rather than firing duels and trench warfare with enemy soldiers.The Army, of course, has stopped haemorrhaging with better infrastructure, logistics and habitats in place in recent years, apart from the long-standing ceasefire with Pakistan along the 110-km Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL).The Army said “significant strides” have been taken to improve the living conditions and operational capabilities of its troops in the region, while the focus has also been on sustainability and environmental conservation.Development of an extensive network of tracks, including to forward posts in the Northern and Central Glaciers, and introduction of all-terrain vehicles have also vastly improved mobility across the glacial heights.“Innovations like the DRDO-developed ATV bridges have enabled troops to overcome natural obstacles, while high-quality Dyneema ropes in aerial cableways ensure seamless supply lines to even the most remote outposts,” an officer said.Induction of heavy-lift helicopters and logistic drones, in turn, has majorly improved supplies to posts cut-off in winters. “Special clothing, mountaineering equipment and fresh rations (instead of tinned food) are now readily available. Gadgets such as pocket weather trackers with soldiers provide timely updates on weather and warn them about possible avalanches,” he said.Mobile and data connectivity, with introduction of VSAT technology, has also made a world of difference. “This leap in technology has enhanced real-time situational awareness, telemedicine capabilities, and the well-being of our soldiers by keeping them connected with their families,” he said.State-of-the-art medical infrastructure at Siachen, including telemedicine nodes established by ISRO, provides critical medical support to not only troops but also residents and tourists in the Nubra Valley. Facilities in Partapur and Siachen base camp have some of the best medical and surgical specialists, HAPO (high-altitude pulmonary oedema) chambers, oxygen-generation plants and life-support systems. “All endeavours are made to save every life in this challenging terrain,” the officer said.","Indian troops occupied almost all the dominating heights from 15,000 to 22,000-feet in the world’s highest and coldest battlefield.

'No need for cell towers': China has revolutionised smartphone communications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/no-need-for-cell-towers-china-has-revolutionised-smartphone-communications/articleshow/109246416.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for satellite communications , Chinese scientists have developed the world's first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly, without the need for ground-based infrastructure. Named ""Tiantong,"" which translates to ""connecting with heaven,"" the initiative draws inspiration from the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, aiming to bridge communication gaps rather than create them.The Tiantong-1 satellite series, which began with its first launch on August 6, 2016, now includes three satellites in a geosynchronous orbit at 36,000km, covering the entire Asia-Pacific region.This breakthrough came to fruition when Huawei Technologies released the world’s first smartphone supporting satellite calls in September of the previous year, leading the way for other manufacturers like Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo to follow suit, a South China Morning Post report said.These technological advancements have proven invaluable, particularly in emergency situations where traditional communication networks are compromised. For instance, during the 6.2-magnitude earthquake in Gansu province on December 18, affected individuals could maintain contact with the outside world thanks to the satellite call function available on their smartphones.“Direct satellite connectivity for mobile phones has become a new development trend, and satellite communication will gradually become popular among the general public,” noted a team led by Cui Wanzhao from the China Academy of Space Technology. Their work, detailed in the Aerospace Science and Technology journal, highlights the overcoming of significant technical challenges related to passive intermodulation (PIM), which can degrade the quality of satellite calls.By addressing the PIM issue, the team has enabled exceptionally sensitive reception capabilities in the Tiantong satellites, allowing them to pick up signals from standard smartphones without the need for external antennas. This capability is critical, especially given the satellites' exposure to extreme temperature variations and their operation across multiple frequency bands.The idea for such a satellite came about after 2008, when Sichuan, a province in southwestern China, was struck by a devastating magnitude-8 earthquake, resulting in the tragic loss of over 80,000 lives.What made the situation far worse back then was the communication breakdowns in affected areas, which in turn severely hindered rescue operations, thus compounding the crisis.In response to this disaster, the Chinese government started the Tiantong Project, a satellite communication system. The purpose of the satellite is to provide universal access to communication services irrespective of socio-economic status.China's advancements in this field are securing its position as a leader in satellite communication technology globally, heralding a new era where geographic isolation no longer equates to communication isolation.","Chinese scientists have developed the world's first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly.

Olsen stated, ""Today’s plea and sentencing brings to an end more than four decades of betrayal and deceit by the defendant. Rocha admitted to acting as an agent of the Cuban government at the same time he held numerous positions of trust in the US government, a staggering betrayal of the American people and an acknowledgment that every oath he took to the United States was a lie.""Under the terms of the plea agreement, Rocha is required to cooperate fully with the US government, which includes assisting with any damage assessments related to his espionage activities . He must also forfeit all retirement benefits owed by the US based on his former employment, and any profits from publications related to his criminal conduct or US government service.This case underscores the ongoing challenges and complexities of national security, particularly in relation to foreign espionage within government ranks. The lengthy sentence reflects the severity of Rocha's actions and serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of betraying national trust.","Victor Manuel Rocha, a former US ambassador to Bolivia and National Security Council official, has pleaded guilty and been sentenced for secretly acting as an agent for Cuba over several decades.

They were 62.The twins, listed by Guinness World Records as the oldest living conjoined twins, died April 7 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, according to obituaries posted by Leibensperger Funeral Homes of Hamburg.The cause of death was not detailed.""When we were born, the doctors didn't think we'd make 30, but we proved them wrong,"" Lori said in an interview when they turned 50, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. George came out as transgender in 2007.The twins, born Sept. 18, 1961, in West Reading, Pennsylvania, had distinct brains but were joined at the skull. George, who had spina bifida and was 4 inches shorter, was wheeled around by Lori on an adaptive wheeled stool. Despite each having to go where the other went, it was ""very important"" to both ""to live as independently as possible,"" the obituary said.Both graduated from a public high school and took college classes. George went along for six years as Lori worked in a hospital laundry. Lori - ""a trophy-winning bowler,"" according to the obituary notice - gave up the job in 1996 so her sibling could launch a country music career.""Since the age of 24, they have maintained their own residence and have traveled extensively,"" the obituary notice said. Over the years, they appeared in many documentaries and talk shows, as well as in an episode of the FX medical drama ""Nip/Tuck.""The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Lori was once engaged to be married but that her fiance died in an automobile accident.""When I went on dates,"" Lori said, ""George would bring along books to read.""The twins said in a 1997 documentary that they had different bathing schedules and showered one at a time. George spoke of giving someone you love and respect ""the privacy and compromise in situations that you would want them to give you."" Lori said compromise meant ""you don't get everything you want right when you want it.""Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births when identical twins from a single embryo fail to separate. About 70% are female, and most are stillborn. Only a small percentage are joined at the head, with nearly three-quarters joined at the chest and others at the abdomen or pelvis.Separation was deemed risky for the Schappell twins, but Lori Schappell told The Associated Press in a 2002 interview at the twins' apartment in a high-rise seniors complex that she didn't think such an operation was necessary in any case.""You don't mess with what God made, even if it means you enjoy both children for a shorter time,"" she said. In the 1997 documentary, George also strongly ruled out the idea of separation, saying, ""Why fix what is not broken?""It isn't immediately clear who will now take the title of oldest living conjoined twins. The oldest ever documented were Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, who died in 2020 at age 68.

Key findings:

Demographic differences in legalization views:

Perceived impacts of legalization:

As the US continues to see a shift in the legal landscape for marijuana, with many states legalizing it for medical or recreational use, Pew Research Center has released new findings on Americans' attitudes and experiences with marijuana.High support for legalization : About 90% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form, either for medical only (32%) or both medical and recreational uses (57%).Only 11% believe it should not be legal at all. This sentiment has remained relatively stable over the past five years.Age: Support is lowest among those 75 and older, with only 31% backing legalization for both medical and recreational use. This contrasts with 71% of those under 30.Political Affiliation: 42% of Republicans support full legalization, versus 72% of Democrats. More conservative individuals within both groups are less likely to support.Race and Ethnicity: Hispanic and Asian Americans show lower support (45% each) compared to Black (65%) and White (59%) adults.Growing General Support: Support for legalization has surged over two decades. In 2023, 70% supported legalization, up from around 30% in 2000.Usage Trends : 50.3% of US adults have used marijuana at least once, though only 23% used it in the past year and 15.9% in the past month.Economic: 52% see legalization as economically beneficial, 17% disagree, and 29% see no impact.Criminal justice: 42% believe legalization makes the criminal justice system fairer, 18% see a negative impact, and 40% see no change.Drug use: 27% think legalization reduces the use of drugs like heroin, while 29% believe it increases it, and 42% see no effect.Community safety: 21% say it increases safety, 34% disagree, and 44% see no impact.Support for reduced penalties: Two-thirds of adults favor releasing those jailed for marijuana only, and 61% support expunging these offenses from criminal records.State legalization status: As of March 2024, 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use.This research highlights the complex and evolving relationship between American society and marijuana as legal and societal perceptions continue to change.","90% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form.

We struggle with these basic things that 20, 30 years ago weren't really a concern,"" he told AFP while on the campaign trial.""When I looked at American politics, I didn't feel like it was an accurate representation of not just me as an individual, but as America as a whole.""You cannot tell me that those two are the best that we can do.""Ebey, a middle-school math teacher, has policies on education, crime, health care and tax, but says he was really looking for a way to show the need ""to hit reset on American politics.""So he legally changed his name in court, and is collecting signatures in a longshot bid to get himself on the ballot.Last weekend, he arrived at a park in downtown Dallas, set up his table and diligently arranged pens and paper to gather signatures.Wearing a T-shirt promoting his campaign, he brandished his driver's licence to prove his name change is for real.Some people eye him with curiosity, others laugh and take photos. He tries to address them, though he's not always lucky.Once in a while, he converts an instant fan.""He's just a voice to say 'Yeah! We want anyone else besides these two.' That's why I'm voting for this guy,"" said Brandon Rios, 28, who works in the financial sector.""Anybody could get up there and do a better job than Donald Trump or Biden at this point. That's my take.""Vincent James, 68, retired, was more downbeat, saying ""I appreciate what he's doing but I don't think it's going be very effective.""In Texas, it takes more than 113,000 signatures from voters who have not taken part in party primaries to add a candidate to the presidential ballot.If he doesn't make the cut in Texas or elsewhere, it won't be for lack of trying.

"Battleground Pennsylvania: Trump holds rally, Biden plans tax speech as rematch heats up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/battleground-pennsylvania-trump-holds-rally-biden-plans-tax-speech-as-rematch-heats-up/articleshow/109269816.cms,"PHILADELPHIA: Former US President Donald Trump heads to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday for a rally and a fundraiser just days before he is set to go on trial in New York over an alleged hush money scheme.He will be closely followed by President Joe Biden , who will make three Pennsylvania stops next week, speaking first in his hometown of Scranton about his push to reform the US tax code.With 19 electoral votes - one of the highest counts among all 50 states - and voters that swing between backing Democrats like Biden and Republicans like Trump, Pennsylvania is a top prize in the 2024 presidential and is likely to see many more visits in coming months.Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by less than 1.5%, or roughly 80,000 votes, after Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by less than 45,000 votes in 2016. State opinion polls taken in March swing from showing Biden with a 10-percentage-point lead to Trump up 4 points, election data site FiveThirtyEight shows.Democrats are betting on a strong turnout in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs, a region that accounts for 33% of all voting registrations, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state. Trump and Republicans are looking to run up huge margins in less populous, largely white counties to offset urban votes.Biden, who has been to Pennsylvania four times so far this year, will also travel to the Pittsburgh area and Philadelphia over three days, the White House said on Friday.Trump is expected to be in Manhattan on Monday for the beginning of his first criminal trial, a case involving hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. The trial could last several weeks. Trump's Saturday rally at Schnecksville Fire Hall targets the Lehigh Valley, a mix of Rust Belt cities, sprawling suburbs and rural towns. It includes Northampton County, one of two counties Biden flipped in 2020, which has long been a reliable bellwether of statewide success.""If you win Northampton County, you are likely to win the state. It's that important of a location,"" Chris Borick, a political science professor at Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg University, said of Trump's rally.The former president will attend a fundraiser before his rally in Bucks County, another bellwether region that Biden narrowly won in 2020. The event is hosted by Jim Worthington, a wealthy gym owner who has pressured Trump to stop criticizing mail-in voting. Roughly 200 people are expected, and the event should generate several million dollars, according to two sources familiar with the event.It will be a ""razor-thin race,"" Borick predicted.SENATE RACE , POPULATION DECLINESPennsylvania is a sprawling, politically complex place where voters historically have often elevated consensus-minded statewide candidates, a history that could affect the closely watched US Senate race.Incumbent Bob Casey, a Democrat, will battle Republican Dave McCormick, a wealthy former hedge fund executive, one of just a handful of races in 2024 that will decide who controls the Senate.Population shifts could also affect the race. Pennsylvania's population topped 13 million in 2021, but has declined in the two ensuing years, finishing at 12.96 million people last year. Declines since 2020 have come from counties that Biden won, according to an analysis by Franklin & Marshall College.Democrats continue to lose their voting registration advantage in the state as they face defections from rural and blue-collar voters, who are joining Republicans or registering as unaffiliated, according to state voter data.In 2020, Democrats held a roughly 700,000-voter registration advantage, but that has narrowed to 400,000 this year as Democratic voters switched to unaffiliated.The defections are due to voters who supported Republican candidates but never bothered to change their party status until now, some political analysts believe.","Former US President Donald Trump heads to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday for a rally and a fundraiser.

The Manila-based lending agency in its 'Asian Development Outlook' said potential supply chain disruptions from the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East would weigh on the economy, the Dawn newspaper reported.It said if reforms are implemented, growth is forecast to restart gradually this fiscal year and improve slightly next year.""The outlook is uncertain, with high risks on the downside. Political uncertainty that affects macroeconomic policy-making will remain a key risk to the sustainability of stabilisation and reform efforts,"" the ADB said in its report.The ADB predicted 1.9 per cent growth in the fiscal year 2024 (ending on June 30, 2024) and then gradually improve to 2.8 per cent in the fiscal year 2025, driven by higher confidence, reduced macro-economic imbalances, adequate progress on structural reforms, greater political stability, and improved external conditions.The shift back to positive growth will come from a recovery in both agriculture and industry, it said.Meanwhile, real gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow by 1.9 per cent in 2024, driven by a rebound in private sector investment linked to progress on reform measures and transition to a new and more stable government.The ADB said the economy shrank as floods, uncertainty, and disrupted external support caused public investment to plunge and private investment and industry to contract.""Inflation reached a 5-decade high as supply disruption and currency depreciation propelled increases in food and energy prices,"" the agency said.""Inflation is projected to moderate somewhat this year, and more next year, under stabilisation policies. Improving women's financial inclusion is critical to strengthen growth,"" it said.The report further forecast that inflation will remain at about 25 per cent this year, driven by higher energy prices, but was expected to ease in 2025.The ADB highlighted that support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a medium-term reform agenda would considerably improve market sentiment and catalyse affordable external financing from other sources, the Dawn newspaper reported.On the supply side, it noted growth would be led by post-flood recovery in agriculture. The report said output would rise from a low base on improved weather conditions and a government package of subsidised credit and farm inputs supporting expanded area under cultivation and improved yields, the report said.Higher farm output would help expand manufacturing, which would also benefit from the increased availability of critical imported inputs. Large-scale manufacturing expanded in three of the first six months of 2024, the report highlighted.According to the report, the relaxation of import restrictions, coupled with economic recovery, was expected to widen the current account deficit.However, imports were expected to expand during the year as domestic demand strengthened and the stabilisation of the currency market made it easier for firms to import inputs. Thus, the current account deficit was projected to widen to 1.5 per cent of the GDP in 2024.The report pointed out that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debt, exacerbated by tight global financial conditions.The ADB said tax collection increased by 29.5 per cent, as reforms in the personal income tax, higher taxes on property transfers, and the reintroduction of taxes on cash withdrawals from banks and the issuance of bonus shares raised direct tax collections, the Dawn reported.","The Asian Development Bank has said that Pakistan's economic outlook remains uncertain.

'All women be treated without discrimination': UN urges Pakistan



NEW DELHI: Women and children in Pakistan belonging to religious minority communities are vulnerable to forced religious conversion and marriage, sexual violence and trafficking, the UN experts said on Thursday.The statement further called upon the Pakistani authorities to treat women including those belonging to ""Hindu and Christian"" communities without discrimination.“All women and girls must be treated without discrimination, including those belonging to the Christian and Hindu communities, or indeed other religions and beliefs,” they added.""Christian and Hindu girls remain particularly vulnerable to forced religious conversion, abduction, trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, domestic servitude and sexual violence"", the experts said in a statement.“The exposure of young women and girls belonging to religious minority communities to such heinous human rights violations and the impunity of such crimes can no longer be tolerated or justified,” the statement read.Taking on the religious laws that justify some of these crimes, the statement said, “Perpetrators often escape accountability, with police dismissing crimes under the guise of ‘love marriages’.”Stressing on the importance of a woman's right to choose, the UN experts said that child, early, and forced marriages cannot be justified on religious or cultural basis.“A woman’s right to choose a spouse and freely enter into marriage is central to her life, dignity and equality as a human being and must be protected and upheld by law,” the experts said.Highlighting that, under international law, consent is immaterial when the victim is a child under the age of 18, the experts stressed upon dissolving marriages contracted under coercion.Highlighting the case of Mishal Rasheed, a girl who was abducted, sexually assaulted and forced to marry her abductor, the UN experts called upon the Pakistani authorities to treat all women and girls without discrimination.The experts further urged the authorities to raise the age of marriage for girls to 18.“The Pakistani authorities must enact and rigorously enforce laws to ensure that marriages are contracted only with the free and full consent of the intended spouses, and that the minimum age for marriage is raised to 18, including for girls,” they said.","Women and children in Pakistan belonging to religious minority communities are vulnerable to forced religious conversion and marriage, sexual violence and trafficking, the UN experts said on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to woo Indian tourists back to Maldives, a major tourism body in the island nation has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.The Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) disclosed its intention to hold discussions with India's high commissioner in the Maldives, Munu Mahawar, to explore ways to enhance travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries.The decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.According to statistics from the Maldives' ministry of tourism, India, which was previously one of the top visitor countries, has slipped to the sixth position in terms of tourist arrivals. China currently leads with the highest number of tourists, followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, and Germany.Following discussions held at the Indian high commission in Male, MATATO announced plans to collaborate closely with the Indian high commission to boost tourism initiatives. This includes launching comprehensive road shows across key Indian cities and organizing influencer and media familiarization trips to the Maldives in the coming months.MATATO emphasized the importance of India as a crucial tourist market for the Maldives and expressed its eagerness to partner with prominent travel associations and industry stakeholders in India to promote the Maldives as a premier travel destination.This initiative comes amid tensions between the Maldives and India, with Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu previously requesting the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the country, citing sovereignty concerns.

Unpopular Rishi Sunak in 'doom loop' as UK PM's victory in doubt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unpopular-rishi-sunak-in-doom-loop-as-uk-pms-victory-in-doubt/articleshow/109282105.cms,"NEW DELHI: Britain's Conservative leader , Rishi Sunak , hasn't delivered on important promises, and his popularity in opinion polls has dropped. He also caused trouble with a popular Adidas shoe. This makes it likely that he'll lose the upcoming general election .Even with two tax cuts and a slightly better economy, Rishi Sunak's political luck hasn't turned around.Criticism from Boris Johnson , the former Prime Minister, and uncertainty about Nigel Farage's Brexit stance are only making things worse for him.According to political scientist Rob Ford, Rishi Sunak appears helpless in the face of the seemingly unstoppable shift in political momentum away from the ruling Tories.""When the herd moves, it moves. There's not much you can do,"" he told AFP.Sunak, aged 43, has not yet revealed the election date. It's expected that he will schedule it for October or November, but legally, he can delay it until January at the latest.Surveys overwhelmingly indicate that Britons desire an end to the 14-year rule of the Tories, and nothing Sunak has done since assuming the role of Prime Minister 18 months ago seems to be altering their opinions.A recent YouGov poll revealed that the Conservatives would only secure 155 seats in the UK Parliament, a significant decrease from the 365 seats they won under Johnson in the last election in December 2019.The same survey found that Keir Starmer's opposition Labour Party would secure 403 seats, resulting in an impressive 154-seat majority.""Right now, it's very challenging to envision how the Conservatives could stay in government after the next election simply due to the magnitude of the shift they would require,"" remarked Keiran Pedley, director of politics at polling firm Ipsos.Sunak took over from Liz Truss in October 2022 after Tory MPs ousted her following a tumultuous 49 days in office. Truss's mini-budget caused turmoil in financial markets, leading to a decline in the pound and a surge in mortgage payments. Truss had succeeded Johnson, who was removed from office by his colleagues amid scandals, including allegations of illegal parties in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns.The chaos of the two preceding administrations has certainly hindered Sunak, but political analysts argue that he has also worsened his own situation by failing to fulfill promises and failing to resonate with voters.Despite pledging to do so, Sunak has not halted the influx of migrants arriving from France on small boats. NHS waiting lists have increased since he took office. Economic growth remains sluggish, although inflation has decreased by more than half.Rishi Sunak's efforts to steer leadership and policy changes have not gained traction, with some initiatives like relaxing carbon net zero goals to appease drivers and addressing extremism failing to resonate. Analysts believe Sunak is struggling to find a game-changing solution, with public sentiment towards the Conservative Party hitting a low point.A recent Ipsos poll disclosed that 58% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the Conservatives, marking a significant decline in popularity. Sunak's personal favorability rating also took a hit, with a net score of minus 38, the lowest among all politicians surveyed.Critics often point out Sunak's disconnect with the average citizen, labeling him as ""awkward and nerdy"" and quick to appear defensive when challenged. In an attempt to bolster the party's standing, Sunak has been actively engaging with voters across the country amid speculation of a potential leadership challenge following the upcoming local elections on May 2.However, setbacks continue to plague Sunak, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly criticizing his proposal for a comprehensive smoking ban and rumors circulating about the PM's involvement in an AI fund post-election defeat, which Sunak's spokesperson promptly denied.Sunak found himself issuing a public apology to the Samba community after facing backlash for sporting Adidas trainers, leading to mocking headlines questioning his fashion choices. As political commentator Ford highlighted, the negative media coverage and public sentiment can create a detrimental cycle for unpopular politicians.Despite the challenges, observers anticipate a potential shift in polling trends closer to the election day, with some moderate Conservatives likely to rally behind the party to prevent a significant Labour victory and maintain a robust opposition force.With the focus now on minimizing damage and regaining public trust, Sunak faces a critical juncture in his leadership as he navigates through a period of heightened scrutiny and skepticism from both within and outside the party.(With inputs from agencies)","Britain's Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hasn't delivered on important promises, and his popularity in opinion polls has dropped.

Rishi Sunak resists call to set UK election date amid leadership threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-resists-call-to-set-uk-election-date-amid-leadership-threat/articleshow/109266928.cms,"Rishi Sunak is resisting advice from allies to set the date for the UK general election, which they say would help him to head off a threatened leadership challenge by Conservative Party rebels next month.Tory ministers and advisers fear the prime minister will face a concerted effort to oust him if the Conservatives, who trail the Labour Party by about 20 points in opinion polls, suffer a bad result in local and mayoral elections on May 2.The best way to safeguard his position, some argue privately, is to get ahead of the expected fallout by setting the date for the national vote beforehand.The theory, first put forward publicly by former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, is that naming the date would put British politics firmly in campaign mode and reinforce the idea in Tory minds that changing leader again — Sunak is the third premier since the country last went to the polls in 2019 — would stoke more chaos and likely alienate voters even further.Setting out a timeline would “forestall any leadership contest” and put Sunak “back in charge of events,” Osborne, who has retained close links to the administration, said on his Political Currency podcast last month.However, Sunak’s closest advisers are so far reluctant to take the advice. He will not announce the date earlier than necessary because the element of surprise is a key advantage over the opposition, one ally said.A general election must be held by the end of January and Sunak has said his “working assumption” is it will be in the second half of 2024. His advisers have been working around October, November or December as the likeliest options. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has suggested it could be in October.December 12, which would be exactly five years on from the previous Tory election win, has long been floated, people familiar with the matter said. That would give the economy more time to recover and for the Bank of England to cut interest rates. A clash with the US presidential election in election would be avoided, along with any unpredictable spillover on the UK campaigns.It would also get Sunak past the two-year mark in office, unlike a mid-October vote that would see him fall short of that milestone. Sunak’s preference has always been to go long, people familiar with his thinking said.The fatalism settling over Downing Street and the expectation the Tories have only months left in office was illustrated by Sunak’s need to issue vigorous denials he had been discussing possible post-election roles with Blackstone Inc.’s Steve Schwarzman. Two senior Tories told Bloomberg the two men were considering working together on a possible artificial intelligence project.Sunak’s spokesman, Dave Pares, told reporters Monday the suggestion Sunak was in talks to run an AI fund was “not true.” Blackstone’s London office called claims that Schwarzman had discussed roles with Sunak “categorically false,” adding that none of the firm’s leaders have had “this kind of discussion” with government officials.Nonetheless the pair are on good terms. Schwarzman joined Sunak on a panel at the UK’s Global Investment Summit in November, where he touted the importance of businesses quickly adopting AI. Sunak also attended the ground-breaking ceremony of Blackstone’s new building in Mayfair in February.The prevailing view in Westminster is that many Tories are gearing up for a career change after the election, which most expect to be later in the year.Yet speculation about a snap vote as soon as June or July is also persistent. Officials close to Sunak no longer shoot down a possibility they were privately ruling out just a few weeks ago.One reason is some aides think that if Sunak’s position is in peril and it looks as though he can’t survive until the autumn, his best chance of leading the party into the election would be to call a snap vote in June or July.That would likely include a pivot to a tougher line on immigration and even promising to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, to right-wing Tory rebels and to try to stem the movement of former Conservative voters to the populist Reform UK party set up by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage.But there are potential flaws. One is that calling an early election in those circumstances, after a bad showing on May 2, would broadcast to voters that Sunak was forced into it. Tory ministers and officials said Keir Starmer’s Labour would capitalize and put Sunak’s weakness front and center of their campaign.It’s also likely that if Sunak waits until he’s facing an imminent challenge before calling a summer election, his party would step in to prevent him from doing so. Regardless of their view of Sunak, few Conservative members of Parliament want a snap election at a time when the latest YouGov poll on Friday put Labour 26 points ahead and on course for a landslide win.",Rishi Sunak is resisting advice from allies to set the date for the UK general election. They say it would help him to head off a threatened leadership challenge by Conservative Party rebels.

Today's sentence should send a strong message to those who think they can come into our towns and cities to commit violent crime that we will not stop in our efforts to find them and put them before the courts,"" he said.The sentencing hearing at Stafford Crown Court was presided over by Judge Kristina Montgomery, who described the case as ""a very public execution"", in which Aurman had been left to die at the side of the road.It followed the five men's conviction last month at the end of a six-week trial at the same court.Aurman's family stated that there are no words that could ever explain the impact the tragedy has had on their lives.The statement issued through the police reads: ""Today a mother will grow old without her son. A sister will grow up without her brother. We don't want what has happened to us to happen to another family.""It is an unbearable loss for us which has changed our lives.

Prince William adapts to 'WFH' royal duties amid personal challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-william-adapts-to-wfh-royal-duties-amid-personal-challenges/articleshow/109243679.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Prince William is set to resume full-time royal responsibilities with a blend of in-person and digital engagements , forming a new operational strategy that could foreshadow his approach during his future reign. This decision comes after a period of reduced public visibility following his wife, Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis.""William, who had not been seen or heard from in over three weeks since before his wife Kate Middleton announced she had been diagnosed with cancer, returned to public visibility Wednesday with a social media post paying tribute to a leading female soccer player retiring from England’s national team,"" sources indicated this shift aims to maximize his impact while accommodating his current family circumstances, a the Daily Beast report said.In light of his father, King Charles III's step back due to his own health issues, Prince William has been thrust into a more prominent role sooner than anticipated. He spent the school holidays at the Sandringham Estate, balancing family time with preparations for his increased responsibilities.The prince is navigating his duties with a newfound approach to work, integrating more virtual engagements to maintain his presence while managing his familial obligations. ""In many ways the next few weeks and months will be a template for his future reign because he will have similar personnel available after he succeeds to the throne, even if that doesn’t happen for many years,"" a friend of William and Kate shared with The Daily Beast.As the royal family adapts to these personal and public challenges, William's strategy reflects a broader shift in the monarchy's engagement with the public and its causes. The Prince expressed a desire to focus more deeply on fewer causes for greater impact, a pivot from the traditional royal practice of patronizing a vast array of charities, the Daily Beast report said.William's return to a full schedule is planned to coincide with the end of the school term, signaling a return to more regular public appearances. His efforts to balance the demands of his state responsibilities with his role as a family man are setting a precedent for what might be expected during his future kingship.While Kensington Palace has not detailed specific plans, the coming weeks are expected to reveal more about how Prince William will manage his dual roles as a working royal and a supportive family man amid his wife's health challenges.","Prince William is set to resume full-time royal responsibilities with a blend of in-person and digital engagements.

The company plans to simplify its extensive rulebook, which currently spans over 1,300 pages, and reduce the number of middle managers to streamline processes.In a recent meeting in New Jersey, employees were encouraged to self-organize and pitch ideas in a collaborative setting. The firm remains discreet about the exact number of managers to be let go, but reports suggest a significant restructuring in the US operations.Bayer anticipates cost savings of approximately 2 billion euros from these changes. Despite these efforts, Bayer's shares have plummeted by over 50% in the past year, reflecting financial challenges with a debt of around 34 billion euros.The company's commitment to fostering a culture of innovation and patient-centric approach remains unchanged amidst the restructuring. Anderson's vision for a more agile and autonomous workforce signals a shift towards a more collaborative and efficient corporate environment.","Bayer, with nearly 100,000 employees, aims to revamp its organizational structure to improve efficiency and flexibility.

Inside SBTi row that has divided carbon offsets market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/inside-sbti-row-that-has-divided-carbon-offsets-market/articleshow/109280855.cms,"When the biggest funders and promoters of the $2 billion carbon offsets market assembled in London last month, the gathering was billed as a series of technical discussions on subjects such as emissions accounting. But, at least to some attendees, there also appeared to be another motive -- to make a case for why the Science Based Targets initiative, the biggest and most-respected verifier of corporate climate targets, is the main impediment to the growth of a market that advocates deem critical in fighting climate change .In a world full of greenwashing, SBTi has become a gold standard in emissions accountability because of its strict criteria for net-zero plans. It currently limits how corporations can use offsets - credits that companies can buy to ostensibly cancel out their pollution - to achieve their green targets. The issue is one of the most divisive among climate experts. Powerful proponents including former US climate envoy John Kerry argue they're needed to shift money into important sustainability projects, while critics say it's almost impossible to verify the true impact of the instruments.The meetings last month were hosted by the Bezos Earth Fund, a supporter of growing the voluntary carbon market and one of two main funders of SBTi.They were held in a workspace in London's Clerkenwell district. Two SBTi representatives were present and faced a barrage of implicit and direct requests to relax their position on carbon offsets from senior leaders of prominent carbon market standards and lobbying groups, the people said.A month later, on April 9, SBTi made an about-face on offsets that caught even its staff off guard -- the group said it would loosen its rules for how companies can use carbon credits to reduce their reported emissions. That would lead to a boon for the carbon offsets market, which has recently been rocked by turbulence. BloombergNEF says such a change could help annual demand soar to $1.1 trillion in 2050.The move outraged SBTi staff, who called on the CEO and board to resign in an April 10 letter. They argued that the board violated SBTi rules and procedures by making this decision unilaterally, rather than relying on guidance from SBTi's independent technical council, which wasn't informed or consulted.On April 12, SBTi added a clarification to its previous statement, emphasizing that ""no change has been made to SBTi current standards,"" and that any shifts to its rules will go through all of its standard procedures.",SBTi has become a gold standard in emissions accountability because of its strict criteria for net-zero plans.
