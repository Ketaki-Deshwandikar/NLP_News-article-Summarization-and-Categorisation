The IDF said that a military base in southern Israel also sustained minor damage.Sirens sounded in Jerusalem, northern Israel and the Negev, sending Israelis to shelter in safe rooms.

War in Middle East: 5 ways in which Iran could 'punish' Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/war-in-middle-east-5-ways-in-which-iran-could-punish-israel/articleshow/109274571.cms,"Here is how Iran could 'punish' Israel

US drops head to Middle East

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: After an airstrike on its Damascus consulate, which resulted in the deaths of 16 people including a senior Quds Force commander, Iran has vowed retaliation against Israel , the alleged perpetrator. As tensions rise, the nature of Iran's response could significantly influence regional stability.Israel did not claim responsibility for the airstrike on April 1.But Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil.Meanwhile, during a press briefing on Friday, US President Joe Biden expressed his expectation of an imminent attack by Iran on Israel, cautioning Tehran against such actions. Responding to journalists' inquiries about his stance on Iran, Biden's message was concise yet firm. ""Don't,"" he advised Tehran, signaling a stern warning.Highlighting the United States' unwavering support for Israel, Biden reaffirmed the commitment to its defense. ""We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,"" he asserted. This statement emphasizes the strong alliance between the United States and Israel and the US government's readiness to support Israel in the face of potential threats.In response to the volatile situation, several countries have issued travel advisories. Nations such as India, France, Poland, and Russia have cautioned their citizens against traveling to the region. Further emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, Germany urged its citizens on Friday to depart from Iran, indicating growing international concerns over safety in the area.According to reports, an individual with insights from the Iranian leadership revealed that although discussions about a potential attack are ongoing, a definitive decision has yet to be made.Utilizing its arsenal, Iran could launch missile or armed drone strikes against Israeli military sites or infrastructure. This approach would be a direct and visible form of retaliation but would also significantly raise the stakes, potentially drawing regional and international responses.Iran might target Israeli or even US diplomatic missions outside the region. This method would risk involving third countries and escalate tensions on an international scale.Iran might escalate its indirect conflict against Israel by activating its network of allied militant groups across the region. This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, various militias in Syria, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. These groups could increase their attacks against Israeli interests, offering Iran plausible deniability and minimizing direct engagement.Iran has increasingly invested in its cyber capabilities. It could choose to disrupt Israeli critical infrastructure through cyber means, which could be seen as a less bloody form of retaliation but equally disruptive.Iran could leverage its influence to incite uprisings against Israeli control in Palestinian territories, hoping to destabilize internal Israeli security dynamics without direct military engagement.The United States is sending additional assets to the region to enhance regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for US forces, according to a US defence official in Washington. The US already maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East and provides substantial military assistance to Israel.Following Iran's threats of retaliation, Israel has strengthened its air defences and suspended leave for combat units. US President Joe Biden dispatched General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, to Israel for discussions. After meeting with Kurilla on Friday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized the strong bond between Israel and the United States.""Our enemies think that they can pull apart Israel and the United States, but the opposite is true -- they are bringing us together and strengthening our ties,"" Gallant said.","Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel ""must be punished and shall be"" for an operation he said was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil. Iran could launch missile or armed drone strikes against Israeli military sites or infrastructure. It could also incite uprisings against Israeli control in Palestinian territories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109274672,imgsize-167446,width-400,resizemode-4/109274672.jpg"

'Shift in the wind: Major change in Americans’ political leanings ahead of 2024 presidential elections',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shift-in-the-wind-major-change-in-americans-political-leanings-ahead-of-2024-presidential-elections/articleshow/109274835.cms,"A new survey from the Pew Research Center shows a notable shift in voter party identification as the United States heads into the 2024 presidential election, highlighting one of the most evenly split electorates in recent decades.According to the Pew analysis, the American political landscape has seen significant changes since 1996. In 1994, 51% of Americans identified with the Republican Party, with 47% siding with the Democrats.This balance shifted by 2020, where Democrats held a 5% lead over Republicans. However, the latest 2023 data indicates a nearly balanced field, with 49% of voters identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic and 48% as Republicans or leaning Republican.The study also revealed demographic shifts . Around 33% of respondents in 2023 identified as conservative or moderate, compared to 23% who identified as liberal Democrats or leaning liberal. Despite maintaining dominance among Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters, Democratic support among non-Hispanic White voters has declined from 77% in 1996 to 56% in 2023. Meanwhile, Republican support among Hispanic voters has notably increased, tripling from 3% to 9% over the past two decades, a Fox News report said.Polls also indicate that Democratic support among minority voters is decreasing. A recent Gallup poll highlighted that 19% of Black adults now identify as lean Republican or Republican, the lowest percentage recorded by Gallup since 1999, while 66% identify as Democrats or lean Democratic.The shift extends to age demographics as well, with Democrats predominantly preferred by younger voters and Republicans more favored by older voters. Geographically, rural voters have shown increased support for the GOP, with the party holding a 25-point advantage over Democrats, up significantly from an even split in 2008.This evolving voter landscape sets the stage for a competitive rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in November. While Biden secured a win in the 2020 election, the shifting political affiliations reflected in Pew's data suggest a potentially different outcome in the upcoming election.","In 1994, 51% of Americans identified with the Republican Party, with 47% siding with the Democrats.

And we're not going back.""Harris was in the battleground southwestern state just days after its conservative supreme court rolled back reproductive rights to the Civil War era, saying an 1864 ban on abortion was valid.The ruling, which rendered almost all pregnancy terminations illegal with no exceptions for rape or incest, made Arizona the latest state to severely limit the procedure.It came after the US Supreme Court -- with a conservative majority thanks to three Trump appointments -- in 2022 overturned Roe v Wade , the decades-old federal guarantee of abortion rights.While state-level bans are popular with the evangelical wing of the Republican Party and with some of their elected representatives, a majority of the electorate disapproves and has voted to enshrine rights even in conservative states like Kansas.Harris's speech was part of a Democrat strategy to pin the bans on Trump, as they seek to drive support for his November opponent Joe Biden.In the wake of the Arizona court ruling this week, the party is splashing a huge sum of money on an advertising campaign in the must-win state -- aimed at key Democratic target groups: young people, women and Latino voters.They hope that this will help drive turnout and support for Biden, even as many polls show the 81-year-old trailing his populist predecessor.""Overturning Roe was just the opening act of a larger strategy to take women's rights and freedoms,"" said Harris.""Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe, and as he intended they did.""And now because of Donald Trump, more than 20 states in our nation have bans.""Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis.""Trump is on the back foot over the issue, stuck between crowing about his role in removing the nationwide right to abortion and urging states not to implement the kind of bans that are the obvious natural result.On Friday he again proudly boasted of his achievement, and insisted state-level laws were working.""We don't need it any longer because we broke Roe v Wade,"" he told reporters when asked if he would sign a national ban on abortion.""We gave it back to the states and...(it's) working the way it's supposed to.""But writing on his website earlier in the day, he urged Arizona to change its 160-year-old law.""The Governor and the Arizona Legislature must use HEART, COMMON SENSE, and ACT IMMEDIATELY, to remedy what has happened,"" he wrote.""Remember, it is now up to the States and the Good Will of those that represent THE PEOPLE. We must ideally have the three Exceptions for Rape, Incest, and Life of the Mother.""The message, which gave no indication of his preferred time limit on abortion, repeated untrue claims that his Democratic opponents support the execution of babies after birth.",Kamala Harris says Donald Trump wants to take America back to the 1800s.

They can't bomb Thailand,"" she added.Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy, on Friday to assess matters after Myanmar's embattled junta lost yet more territory in the latest round of fighting.Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told Myanmar media some of its troops had surrendered because they were accompanied by their families and talks with Thailand for their return were in progress.He did not respond to a telephone call from Reuters to seek comment.Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the powerful military deposed an elected civilian government, triggering widespread protests it sought to crush with brutal force.Simmering anger against the junta turned into a nationwide armed resistance movement that is now increasingly operating in coordination with established ethnic rebel groups to challenge the military across large parts of the Southeast Asian nation.About 200 Myanmar military personnel withdrew on Thursday to a bridge linking to Mae Sot after the KNU said it had taken control of Myawaddy.But the Myanmar military may still seek to mount a counter-attack, supported by its air force, to regain the town, said Dulyapak Preecharush, an associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Bangkok's Thammasat University.""So there is a question about possible intensification of fighting in the coming days,"" he told Reuters.As fighting in Myanmar intensified, the numbers crossing to Mae Sot from Myawaddy doubled this week to about 4,000 a day.On Thursday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said the fighting in Myanmar should not spill into his country's airspace.In an interview with Reuters last week, Srettha said the Myanmar junta was ""losing strength"", as he pushes to open talks with the regime.Thailand, which says it is keeping neutral in the Myanmar conflict and can accept up to 100,000 people displaced by it, has pursued engagement, including aid deliveries, with its neighbour since Srettha came to power last August.Yet the junta could find itself stretched further after the Arakan Army rebel group warned it would renew an offensive in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine.Arakan Army chief Twan Mrat Naing warned residents of the Rakhine cities of Sittwe and Kyauk Phyu to relocate ahead of ""a decisive battle"", the group said in a statement.One of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic armed forces, the Arakan Army was part of Operation 1027, a major assault by three rebel groups last October that seized significant territory from the junta.","Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is set to visit Mae Sot, just across the Moei River from Myawaddy.

Why the green onion has become a contentious poll issue in the South Korean elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-the-green-onion-has-become-a-contentious-poll-issue-in-the-south-korean-elections/articleshow/109105265.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election on April 10, green onions have unexpectedly taken center stage, overshadowing traditional hot topics like foreign policy and the economy. So contentious is the humble allium that it has been banned from polling stations due to concerns of electoral interference, sparking a wave of discussions among voters and election officials.The green onion frenzy began on March 18 when current president Yoon Suk Yeol visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices.His comment on the reasonable price of green onions, at 875 won ($0.65), stirred controversy as local media revealed the store had discounted the vegetable for his visit.This incident led to online backlash and opposition parties using green onions as a symbol of the president being out of touch with the people.As early voting commenced, photos of voters holding green onions at polling stations flooded social media, accompanied by hashtags like #earlyvotedone and #greenonions875won. Despite the high early voting turnout, reaching 13.8 million out of 44.2 million eligible voters, the National Election Commission (NEC) intervened by prohibiting green onions from polling stations to prevent any potential election interference .The NEC's decision faced ridicule online, with more onion memes circulating on social media platforms. This ban prompted a rush for green onion-themed memorabilia to circumvent the restrictions. Some voters expressed defiance by planning to wear green onion headbands on election day, criticizing the NEC's ban as arbitrary and condescending.One voter, Hyun Jung, voiced her disapproval, questioning the ban's logic and suggesting other items like colored clothing or luxury bags could also be restricted. Despite the ban on green onions, election officials will decide on-site whether green onion-themed items are acceptable, according to an NEC official.Political analyst Yum Seung-yul criticized the NEC's decision, deeming it too hastily implemented. While the ban is within the NEC's discretion, it has raised questions about the reasoning behind prohibiting green onions and the potential impact on voters' freedom of expression .As the election day approaches, the green onion controversy continues to stir debate and creativity among voters. The unexpected focus on this humble vegetable has become a symbol of political discourse and resistance against perceived restrictions on electoral participation.The green onion saga highlights the intersection of political symbolism and everyday life, illustrating how a seemingly mundane item can spark a nationwide conversation during a crucial electoral period. The outcome of the parliamentary election remains uncertain, but one thing is clear – green onions have secured their place in South Korea's political landscape, serving as a reminder of the power of everyday objects in shaping public discourse.",Green onions have taken center stage ahead of South Korea's crucial parliamentary election.

The Taoiseach has repeatedly said it.""In his brief remarks about Gaza during his first speech as Taoiseach on Tuesday, Harris reportedly condemned the Hamas attack on October 7th, which claimed approximately 1,170 lives but also denounced Israel's disproportionate military response, which has resulted in over 33,000 fatalities.Harris in his speech said, ""In Gaza, we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe and seeing innocent children, women and men being starved and slaughtered.

The court found her to have been wrongly jailed over a decade ago on allegations of stealing GBP 75,000 from her Post Office branch in Surrey where she was the sub-postmistress.During the recent hearings of the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry in London, former Post Office managing director David Smith expressed regret for a congratulatory email he had sent following Misra's conviction.""It was intended to be a congratulatory email to the team, knowing that they had worked hard on the case,"" Smith said in his written evidence to the inquiry.""However, knowing what I do now, it is evident that my email would have caused Seema Misra and her family substantial distress to read and I would like to apologise for that...

It was terrible. I haven't accepted the apologies,"" Misra was quoted as telling the BBC.""We had my conviction overturned, nobody came at that time to apologise. And now they just suddenly realised that when they have to appear in a public inquiry , they have to apologise,"" she said.Misra was lodged in Bronzefield prison in south-east England and served four-and-a-half months, later giving birth to her second son wearing an electronic tag.Smith said Misra had been used as a ""test case"" and the success of the case led to more confidence in the faulty Horizon IT accounting system.""How can they do a test on a human being? I'm a living creature. I heard that my case had been used as a test case before. But hearing it again and again, it's just annoying. It makes me more and more angry, to be honest,"" Misra said.The UK government, which formally owns Post Office Ltd, has paid out millions in compensation to hundreds of sub-postmasters - many of them of Indian heritage - impacted by the faulty Horizon software.Earlier in the year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised action in the historic scandal which wrongly accused sub-postmasters of fraud.","Indian-origin ex-manager of a Post Office in England, Seema Misra, was wrongly imprisoned while pregnant.
