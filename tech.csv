The X app has reportedly started notifying users about the same.In a post shared by app developer Nima Owji included a screenshot which showed a message from X.The app notified users that “the hide your checkmark feature of X Premium is going away soon.”Earlier this month, X started adding blue checks to the accounts of “influential” users who have at least 2,500 followers who pay for a premium subscription.

Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer became one of the most popular video game trailers ever released. Such is the level of excitement and anticipation for the game that enthusiasts are now creating shot-for-shot real-life remakes of the GTA 6 trailer .According to Game Rant, YouTuber Andrew Levitt has meticulously recreated the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in Miami.The debut of Grand Theft Auto 6's official reveal trailer in December 2023 had a profound impact on the gaming community, garnering millions of views within hours and boosting Rockstar Games' YouTube channel subscribers to 10 million. This 90-second trailer also became the most liked gaming tweet of all time on Twitter.Grand Theft Auto 5 marked its tenth anniversary in September, and Rockstar's previous major release, Red Dead Redemption 2, reached five years old in October. It's been a considerable amount of time since Rockstar launched a major new game, fueling mounting anticipation for its next Grand Theft Auto instalment. The trailer introduced fans to the game's dual protagonists, Lucia and Jason. The thrilling 90-second reveal concluded by indicating a broad 2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto 6, prompting speculation about its potential release timing next year, with the possibility of being pushed to 2026.Grand Theft Auto 6 is an open-world crime game that transports players back to the vibrant, neon-lit streets of Vice City.While awaiting the next official update from Rockstar, renowned YouTuber Andrew Levitt has taken the initiative to recreate the entire Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in real life. Travelling to Miami, the American city that inspired Grand Theft Auto's Vice City setting, Levitt meticulously captures real-world locations featured in the trailer. Leveraging original footage of specific real-world events depicted in the trailer, Levitt's recreation closely mirrors the original shots. He also incorporates the original trailer's audio, including the iconic track ""Love Is A Long Road"" by Tom Petty, which garnered increased attention on music streaming platforms following the trailer's debut in December.Andrew Levitt also shared a 12-minute behind-the-scenes video detailing his journey through Miami to capture the 38 unique shots of real-world locations that inspired the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer. It was fascinating to witness the meticulous attention to detail, with Rockstar Games faithfully recreating areas of Miami for Vice City, including exact building facades and crosswalk art. Some scenes, like the penthouse pool party, were challenging for Levitt to access, leading him to use a drone camera to replicate several shots from the trailer.The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has accumulated a remarkable 185 million views on YouTube. Fans are eagerly anticipating the release of a second trailer from Rockstar. Despite the upcoming Summer Game Fest, Rockstar typically forgoes participation in industry-wide events, preferring to unveil updates independently. If the game remains on track for a 2025 release, there's a possibility that a second GTA 6 trailer, focusing more on characters and narrative elements, could be revealed later this year.Also read | Top-rated romance anime series for every fan; here's the list","YouTuber Andrew Levitt has recreated the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in Miami.

The company is experimenting with displaying promoted apps in the ""Recommended"" section, which echoes its previous attempts to integrate ads into its operating system .Currently limited to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel within the United States , the ads should help users discover apps from the Microsoft Store , says Microsoft.By placing promoted apps alongside recently installed and frequently used programs, Microsoft hopes to increase exposure for its store offerings.While the promoted apps can be disabled through the Settings app, some users argue that this adds to the growing list of toggles and settings that need to be adjusted to achieve a clean, ad-free Windows 11 experience. The lack of a clear ""Promoted"" label next to the app name has also raised concerns about transparency, as users may not immediately realise that they are being presented with an advertisement rather than a personally relevant recommendation.Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, suggesting that the company may be open to modifying or removing the feature based on user response. The Windows Insider team has stated that the experiment will not apply to commercial devices managed by organisations, perhaps acknowledging the potential for disruption in professional settings.Critics of the move argue that Microsoft should focus on refining the Start menu's functionality and customization options rather than using it as a vehicle for advertising. Some have pointed out that the company already has ample opportunities to showcase its store offerings through the Microsoft Store app itself, as well as through other channels such as email newsletters and targeted online ads.Microsoft has a history of incorporating ads into its Windows operating system, with previous versions featuring promotional spots on the lock screen and Start menu. The company even briefly tested ads within the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before turning off the experiment due to negative feedback from users. This latest move to introduce ads in the Windows 11 Start menu has reignited concerns about the creeping commercialization of the user interface.","Microsoft has begun testing ads within the Windows 11 Start menu.

The investigation comes after numerous complaints from PC gamers experiencing frequent crashes and instability, particularly in games using the Unreal Engine .""Intel is aware of problems that occur when executing certain tasks on 13th and 14th generation core processors for desktop PCs, and is analysing them with major affiliates,"" an Intel spokesperson told ZDNet Korea.The affected CPUs include the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, with users reporting crashes in popular titles such as Fortnite , Tekken 8, and Hogwarts Legacy. Some gamers have experienced an ""out of video memory"" error, while others have faced sudden game exits or complete system lockups.The issue has become so prevalent that Epic Games , the Fortnite and the Unreal Engine developer developer, has published a support notice advising affected users to adjust their BIOS settings to mitigate the crashes. The suggested workarounds involve manually downclocking or undervolting the Intel processors , leading to concerns about these high-end CPUs' stability and performance.In South Korea , the problem has escalated to the point where PC retailers are reporting a significant increase in CPU returns and exchanges. ""The number of consumers visiting the customer center asking to change their 13th and 14th generation core processors has recently increased to more than ten per day,"" stated one company official.The exact cause of the crashes remains unclear, but the widespread nature of the reports has prompted Intel to launch an investigation in collaboration with major affiliates. The company has not yet provided a timeline for the investigation or any potential fixes.The game crashes have raised questions about whether Intel has pushed the clock speeds of its latest CPUs too far, sacrificing stability for performance. Some users have even accused the company of selling unstable processors. The issue has also highlighted the importance of thorough testing and validation before releasing new hardware to the market.Intel is currently investigating the root cause of system crashes that are affecting some of its users. Unfortunately, there are limited options available for affected users to maintain system stability. While downclocking or undervolting the CPUs may provide temporary solution, many gamers are frustrated by the need to compromise on performance to ensure a crash-free experience.","Intel is looking into reports of stability issues and game crashes affecting its high-end 13th and 14th generation Core i9 processors.

Apple acknowledges widespread 'ghost touch' issue affecting multiple Apple Watch models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/apple-acknowledges-widespread-ghost-touch-issue-affecting-multiple-apple-watch-models/articleshow/109225989.cms,"Apple has confirmed that a touch-related bug, previously thought to only impact the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 , is also affecting Series 7, Series 8, and Ultra 1 models. The issue, known as "" ghost touch ,"" causes the watch display to register false touches and exhibit erratic behavior without user interaction.In a memo sent to Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs), the company instructed them not to replace affected watches but to guide customers through a force restart process.This involves simultaneously holding down the side button and the Digital Crown for 10 seconds. Additionally, AASPs have been advised to ensure that the affected Apple Watches are running the latest version of watchOS .In February, the ghost touch issue first came to Apple's attention when reports surfaced of Series 9 and Ultra 2 models experiencing the problem. Users described their watch screens as ""jumping erratically"" and displaying unexpected behavior without input from the wearer.Apple addressed the issue in the recently released watchOS 10.4 update, which presumably fixes the problem for all affected models. However, if the update does not resolve the issue, the wording of Apple's memo suggests that a further fix will be released soon.The confirmation of the issue affecting a broader range of Apple Watch models has led to increased frustration among users who have been experiencing the ghost touch problem. Many have taken to social media to express their displeasure and seek answers from the company.While the force restart workaround may provide temporary relief, users are hopeful that Apple will deliver a permanent solution to the ghost touch issue through a software update. The company's acknowledgment of the problem and its steps to address it has been welcomed by affected customers.As Apple continues to investigate and resolve the ghost touch issue, owners of affected Apple Watch models are advised to ensure their devices are updated to the latest version of watchOS and to contact Apple support or visit an AASP if the problem persists.","Apple has confirmed that a touch-related bug is also affecting Series 7, Series 8, and Ultra 1 models.

"This third-party app offers Netflix, Amazon Prime Video on Apple Vision Pro, here's how it works",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/how-this-third-party-app-is-offering-netflix-amazon-prime-video-on-apple-vision-pro/articleshow/109218693.cms,"Supercut: Price and availability



Supercut app on Vision Pro: Here’s how it works



A new video streaming app called Supercut has started offering Vision Pro-centric versions of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for the headset owners. With this app, users won’t be forced to use the web browser to access these content streaming platforms on Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset. The app will help users stream content on the Vision Pro without letterboxing bars on the top and bottom of the video (which appears on the web browser version of Netflix).Supercut also offers 4K streaming with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support.Supercut is currently available for a $4.99 one-time payment. In a recent post on micro-blogging site X (earlier Twitter), Supercut developer Christian Privitelli announced the app’s availability on the App Store :Supercut offers multiple options including -- playback controls, subtitles, audio output, playback speed, and the ability to skip ahead or back a few seconds. The app will also offer users the ability to easily switch between profiles. It also shows a visual indicator that notifies users whether their video is outputting in one or both of the Dolby formats and what resolution they’re streaming at.In an interview with The Verge, Privitelli said that he’s presenting Netflix in a web view, similar to the one used by Christian Selig’s YouTube player, Juno.He noted that the app “just overlays native UI on top of the website and then modifies the website in a way to make it feel more at home on visionOS.”Netflix also may have an issue with what Privitelli is offering. He said that he tried to contact “a few people” at the company “and just never heard anything back.”Apart from Netflix, the app also includes a basic implementation of Amazon Prime Video. Just like how Netflix appears in a Safari window, the iPad app of Prime Video which is available on the headset is also letterboxed.Supercut even allows users to enter a URL for another service, like YouTube. Privitelli said that offering other services wasn’t part of the initial plan. However, Apple wouldn’t approve it as a Netflix-only app, which forced him to create it as a streaming hub instead.Last year, Netflix announced that it isn’t developing a separate app for the Vision Pro. Moreover, the company also doesn’t offer a seperate app for iPads.Apart from this, Privitelli is also working on an immersive cinema environment similar to the one offered by the Apple TV Plus app. Privitelli posted on X that he expects to roll that out in version 1.2 of Supercut (which is currently in 1.1.2) soon.Privitelli also said adding Hulu or Peacock support may become a challenge for him as the former is now integrated into Disney Plus in the US and he doesn’t have access to the latter in Australia, where he’s based.He noted that his next goal is to integrate Plex, which has a public API. However, he hasn’t started work on that yet. It is important to note that other visionOS apps, such as Cinephile, offer Plex on Vision Pro.",Supercut offers 4K streaming with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support.

Apple Watch Series 10 may feature a new display technology: Here’s how it may help,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-may-feature-a-new-display-technology-heres-how-it-may-help/articleshow/109192584.cms,"How LTPO is better than LTPS

“The LTPO TFT, which Apple is planning to apply to the Apple Watch 10 series OLED, is a method of applying oxide to the driving TFT and some switching TFTs, among the 7 to 8 TFTs. The LTPO TFT, which has been applied to the Apple Watch, used oxide for only two switching TFTs, and LTPS for the rest of the switching TFT and the driving TFT.

Using oxide instead of LTPS for a drive TFT means that oxide is responsible for the TFT that connects directly to the OLED pixel. In LTPO OLED, oxide has been used to reduce leakage current, but in the new LTPO OLED, the role of oxide increases. Panel vendors with strengths in oxide technology may be advantageous.

If the oxide is applied to some of the driving TFTs and switching TFTs in Apple Watch 10 series OLEDs as planned by Apple, LTPS will only be used for the remaining switching TFTs and circuits outside the pixel area. The LTPS role is reduced.”

Apple Watch Series 10 which is expected to launch this year may reportedly arrive with a new display technology. A new supply chain report claims that the new tech will lower power consumption and improve efficiency. This means that the upcoming smartwatch may also offer a significant improvement in the overall battery life.According to a report by The Elec, the Apple Watch Series 10 is likely to get an upgraded OLED display that will come with low-temperature polycrystalline oxide ( LTPO ) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology.The OLED screen used in current Apple Watch models also uses LTPO TFT for only two switching transistors. Meanwhile, the rest of the transistors use the less efficient low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) technology.However, for the Apple Watch Series 10, the company is expected to use a LTPO panel that will expand to more transistors, the report adds.The report explains:This means that the Apple Watch Series 10’s OLED display is expected to be significantly more power efficient and may drain less battery life.",The Apple Watch Series 10 is likely to get an upgraded OLED display that will come with low-temperature polycrystalline oxide ( LTPO ) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology.
