Stone hurled at Jagan Mohan Reddy ignites war of words among Andhra Pradesh parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stone-hurled-at-jagan-mohan-reddy-ignites-war-of-words-among-andhra-pradesh-parties/articleshow/109288484.cms,"AMARAVATI: The YSRCP and the TDP in Andhra Pradesh engaged in a war of words on Sunday after a stone was hurled at ruling party chief and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy when he was canvassing for votes, which left a small injury on his left temple. The chief minister was hit by a stone on the left side of his head in Vijayawada on Saturday night while canvassing.The stone was allegedly hurled by some unknown persons at high speed, leading to a small cut.YSRCP General Secretary S Ramakrishna Reddy claimed that the attack was a pre-meditated cold-blooded attack on the CM. ""Who would have planned such an attempt? It stems from the insecurity that the TDP is experiencing as they are witnessing the response our leader is getting through the poll campaign, through the roadshows and 'siddham sabhas' (meetings),"" he said, addressing a press conference.Ramakrishna Reddy alleged that TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu had recently instigated the crowd in his 'prajagalam' (canvassing) meetings to attack Jagan Reddy, and claimed that Naidu and his party would benefit if the YSRCP chief could not mingle with the masses. ""This leads us to presume that the TDP and their leader (Naidu) are responsible for the attack,"" he said, adding that the injury is a fact and its location sensitive. Further, he claimed that the opposition party is trying to downplay the incident due to the ""fear of exposure"" and also resorting to making inhumane comments.Meanwhile, YSRCP Nellore Lok Sabha candidate V Vijayasai Reddy alleged that Naidu ""never engaged in politics believing in development"". ""It has been proven again that he (Naidu) engages in cowardly politics, believing in violence and conspiracies,"" Vijayasai Reddy in a post on social media platform X.Ruling party leaders, ministers and others castigated Naidu and the TDP, claiming that the opposition party was involved in the attack on the CM. Chandrababu Naidu condemned the attack on Reddy.""I strongly condemn the attack on Jagan. I request the Election Commission of India (ECI) to initiate an impartial and unbiased inquiry into the incident and punish the responsible officials,"" he said in a post on X. However, the TDP alleged that the attack on Jagan Reddy was stage-managed.Backing Naidu's appeal to the Election Commission to undertake an impartial and unbiased probe into the attack, TDP Spokesperson Pattabhiram Kommareddy questioned the timing and circumstances of the attack. ""It only tends to raise a question about the validity of an act like this when it is so coincidental, yet in sync. It wouldn't be the first time that the YSRCP has staged such an act, much like the infamous 'kodi kathi' drama, not only for sympathy but to also create confusion and unrest, right when the elections are around the corner,"" Kommareddy alleged.Condemning the alleged attack on the CM, Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) President Y S Sharmila said she believes it was accidental. However, if it was not so, she said, everybody should condemn it. Sharmila said she is praying to god for the quick recovery of her older brother Jagan Reddy.Ramakrishna Reddy said the ruling party would submit a representation to the EC to expedite the inquiry into the incident and unearth the facts. Jagan Reddy is unperturbed by the attack he said, but he is taking rest today, pausing his 'Memantha Siddham' (We Are All Ready) election canvassing bus tour, to resume on Monday.","YSRCP General Secretary S Ramakrishna Reddy claimed that the attack was a pre- meditated cold-blooded attack on the CM.

"All eyes on Nagpur, a former Cong bastion, due to 'development man' Gadkari",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-eyes-on-nagpur-a-former-cong-bastion-due-to-development-man-gadkari/articleshow/109287265.cms,"NAGPUR: The battle for the Nagpur Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra is among the most watched in the country due to the presence of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari , a hardcore RSS loyalist who has a legion of admirers for his development work as well as the penchant for talking straight.In 2014, he defeated seven-time MP Vilas Muttemwar by a margin of 2.84 lakh votes and retained the seat in 2019 by defeating current Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole by 2.16 lakh votes.Nagpur, with 22,18,259 voters comprising 11,10,840 males, 11,07,197 females and 222 third-gender persons, is Vidarbha's largest city and has connection to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the BJP , as well as Ambedkarism on the other end of the spectrum, since the legendary social reformer converted to Buddhism here.The seat was a bastion of the Congress, which has won it 13 out of 17 times. ""Gadkari is part of the RSS ecosystem and is very close to the organisation. He is widely seen as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP. These two aspects make Nagpur a very important seat,"" senior journalist and political analyst Vivek Deshpande told PTI.Gadkari won in 2014 due to the Modi wave and in 2019 for his reputation as a taskmaster who set several infrastructure projects rolling in Nagpur as well as the country, he said. His ability to talk straight has given him a reputation as the only challenger to Modi, Deshpande claimed.""Factors like Pulwama which helped BJP in 2019 are missing. Its induction of allegedly tainted leaders has seen BJP getting attacked with washing machine jibes. The opposition, unlike last time, is united. The reputation of Rahul Gandhi as a serious politician has improved after his Bharat Jodo and Nyay Yatras,"" Deshpande said.Moreover, unemployment and inflation are talking points, he said, adding the deciding factor in Nagpur will be Gadkari's work and his larger-than-life image among voters. Some 12 lakh voters in Nagpur belong to the Dalit, Kunbi, Halba and Muslim communities and these could upset caste equations in Gadkari's pursuit for a third straight win, he claimed. Patole got 4.5 lakh votes in 2019 despite being from outside Nagpur, whereas the Congress' 2024 candidate Vikas Thakre is a local leader, which too will play a role, Deshpande said.Former MP and senior Congress leader Vilas Muttemwar punched holes in the BJP's claims that it had brought about all round development in Nagpur. The BJP's development works are not those that bring relief to people, he said, adding that it had not brought down prices of gas and fuel even when international rates of these items were low. He said Comptroller and Auditor General reports cited cost overruns in Dwarka Expressway project, which is being helmed by Gadkari's ministry of road transport and highways.Muttemwar also said Gadkari's reported statement that he will not come to seek votes but would still win by a margin of over five lakh would also be factors in the Lok Sabha polls in the city. ""Nagpur is a Congress bastion. The Bharatiya Janata Party won in 2014 and 2019 due to false promises and fake allegations against the UPA government under Dr Manmohan Singh. People are fully aware now. The wave is against the BJP as people are distressed,"" he claimed.Vikas Thakre will win against Gadkari by more than one lakh votes, he asserted. He was countered by MLC Pravin Datke, former BJP city chief and cluster in charge of four Lok Sabha seats, who said Gadkari's victory margin would increase.The voting percentage will increase by 5 per cent, Gadkari will get 62-64 per cent of votes polled, up from 59 per cent in 2019, and he will win with a margin of 5 lakh votes, Datke claimed. ""Nagpur is among the most developed cities under the leadership of Gadkari and (Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and local MLA) Devendra Fadnavis.Everyone, irrespective of caste and religion, loves Gadkari. He has made Nagpur famous with his development works,"" Datke said. Moreover, Gadkari has immense ground connect since he meets some 5000 people in his constituency every 15 days, all of which will ensure a handsome victory, he added.Meanwhile, CPI Nagpur district joint secretary Dr Yugal Rayalu said inflation, unemployment and use of probe agencies to attack the opposition, resulting in the arrests of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, will harm the BJP. The CPI is supporting Congress' Vikas Thakre, he added.","Gadkari is widely seen as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP.

EC's novel initiative to increase voter turnout in UP: Polling stations in housing societies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ecs-novel-initiative-to-increase-voter-turnout-in-up-polling-stations-in-housing-societies/articleshow/109287418.cms,"LUCKNOW: The Election Commission of India has set up more than 200 polling stations within housing societies in the urban areas of Uttar Pradesh to increase the voter turnout in the politically crucial state.In an interview with PTI, state's Chief Electoral Officer Navdeep Rinwa said the poll body is targeting urban areas that have registered a low voter turnout in the past and expressed that Uttar Pradesh will secure the first position as far as voting percentage is concerned.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the voting percentage in Uttar Pradesh was a tepid 59.11 per cent.""We have taken a number of important steps to ensure that all kinds of barriers that prevent voters from casting votes are removed. We have ensured that the polling station is located within a two-kilometre radius of every voter.""Also in urban areas, we have undertaken a new initiative of setting up polling stations within gated communities and multi-storeyed housing societies where there has been a low voter turnout in the past,"" Rinwa told PTI.The senior official said 200-plus polling booths have been set up across the state, with Noida taking the lead.""Uttar Pradesh has the maximum number of such polling stations and Noida has taken the lead in this regard. Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Bareilly and even Mathura will have such polling stations,"" Rinwa said.Asked if the polling percentage in Uttar Pradesh will exceed 60 per cent this time, the CEO said, ""I am confident that UP voters will score the first division and pass with flying colours.""Rinwa highlighted that SVEEP (Systematic Voter's Education and Electoral Participation) activities are also ongoing in the state.SVEEP is a flagship programme of the Election Commission for voter education, spreading voter awareness and promoting voter literacy.On the tepid voter turnout in 2019, Rinwa said, ""To find out the reasons, we have taken a bottoms-up approach for each assembly constituency.""We have asked the EROs (electoral registration officers) and DMs (district magistrates) to prepare a Turnout Implementation Plan (TIP) -- an initiative of the ECI -- to identify the reasons for the low turnout in each assembly constituency and polling station. This is happening for the first time in the country,"" Rinwa said.Rinwa said, this time, more than 15.30 crore people across Uttar Pradesh would be exercising their franchise and the voting will be held from 7 am to 6 pm -- except in two assembly constituencies of Sonbhadra district, as it was earlier affected by Left Wing Extremism.Sonbhadra shares its boundaries with Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.""Keeping this in mind, the polling timing of 7 am to 4 pm has been proposed to the ECI. The ECI is yet to approve the timing, as it is done phase-wise,"" he said.Robertsganj (SC) Lok Sabha seat in Sonbhadra will go to polls in the seventh phase on June 1.Asked about the challenges in implementing 'One Nation, One Election' in a state like Uttar Pradesh, Rinwa said, ""There will be no problems if we have the necessary infrastructure, mainly, sufficient number of EVMs.""""We have over 1.62 lakh polling stations... if 'One Nation, One Election' is implemented, a minimum of 3.24 lakh EVMs will be needed, one for LS polls, and one for assembly polls,"" he added.The official further said the weather in April and May will be hot, and it might discourage the voters from coming out.""Keeping this in mind, we have asked our DEOs (district election officers) to ensure clean drinking water at polling stations and shade for the voters standing in queues.""We have also asked for some furniture for senior citizens, pregnant women and physically challenged voters,"" Rinwa said.Rinwa said the people have been advised to use the early morning hours to cast their vote to avoid the afternoon sun.On steps taken by the ECI to ensure that the polling staff also remains physically and medically fit during the election period, the UP CEO said, ""We will provide medical kits to all the polling teams, along with a list of do's and don'ts.""On the challenges faced by the poll body, the official said, ""In UP and Bihar, there are a number of voters in the voters' list, who do not exist. This happens as people do not file Form 7 to get their names deleted.""""In the recent special summary revision, we have taken a number of steps to ensure that our voter list is clean,"" he added.Form 7 has to be filed in case of the death of a voter, shifting to a different constituency, and duplication of a voter's identity among other reasons.

Western media questions Indian democracy in string of op-eds on Lok Sabha elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/western-media-questions-indian-democracy-in-string-of-op-eds-on-lok-sabha-elections/articleshow/109276663.cms,"LONDON: Opinion pieces on the Indian elections have been appearing thick and fast in the Western press.On Monday, the Times ran a “leading article” saying: “Mr Modi is likely to be recognised as probably the most significant Indian leader since independence”, putting his popularity down to spectacular growth, new technology, and welfare policies.“Modi has cultivated the image of a strongman… thumbing his nose at Western liberals and telling Indians their turn in the global spotlight has come.This plays as well with the poor as the rich elites,” it said.But “there is a darker side to his popularity,” the editorial continued. “Modi embraces ‘Hindutva”, playing up a nationalist Hinduism and discriminating against and passing laws that “disadvantage India’s large Muslim minority”. It said Modi was “intolerant of the opposition”, referring to the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and claimed that “heavy pressure has been imposed on India’s once lively press to toe the government line,” including occasional harassment of the BBC.The arrest of AAP ministers and freezing of Congress bank accounts have been frequently mentioned.Edward Luce, associate editor at the FT, asked on X: “Will this be India's last democratic election”, whilst Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian’s correspondent, wrote: “Analysts and opponents have warned this could be the most one-sided election in India’s history.”The FT’s editorial board penned an article titled “The ‘mother of democracy’ is not in good shape”, saying: “PM Modi has repeatedly called India the ‘mother of democracy’. If so, an intensifying clampdown on opposition parties suggests this matriarch of representative government is in ill health. Harassment, often by tax or legal authorities, has become common for government critics… The BJP ’s muscular Hindu nationalism has eroded India’s tradition of secular democracy.”Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote that the ""more progressive and successful part of the country"" was ""drifting away from the poverty-ridden north"" and its ""majoritarian leader."" “A Hindu rashtra, or nation-state, will play well in the north. The very prospect of such an outcome fills the south with dread,” he claimed.In the FT, Ruchir Sharma argued that Modi had expanded his base, not because of Hindutva ideology, but because he was delivering economic progress, and that the people of India were prepared to “trade political freedom for perceived progress” in the same way countries such as Taiwan and South Korea put together long runs of rapid growth with low inflation under autocratic leaders.All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout. The Economist published a list of books on Hindutva, telling its readers that non-Indians needed to understand the origins and core ideas of the “dangerous ideology”.“The residual Congress ideology is a sort of English Fabian socialism left out too long in the sun. The Congress manifesto was a standard left-of-centre list of desirable state handouts.It said little about more inclusive growth. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Congress deserves the obscurity to which it is headed because of its acute intellectual shortcomings,” Philip Collins wrote in the Times.","All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout.

Politicians' vocal cords suffer silently as poll campaign picks up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/politicians-vocal-chords-suffer-silently-as-poll-campaign-picks-up/articleshow/109278110.cms,"As we brace for the impending political showdown with candidates giving it their vocal all, spare a thought for the unsung hero — the voice box — that often bears the brunt of their campaign rhetoric. With World Voice Day approaching on April 16 — a day dedicated to spotlighting the role vocal cord health plays in our personal and professional lives — it might be timely to explore how politicians, notorious for pushing their voices to the limit, struggle to keep their pipes in shape.Voice surgeon Dr Nupur Nerurkar says she often encounters politicians with “phonotraumatic lesions” or benign growths on the vocal cords due to overuse or non-stop speeches . “I see politicians all year round. That’s because unfortunately, most seek help only after three to six months of symptoms,” says Nerurkar whose yearly tally sees close to 15 politicians lining up for assistance with raspy, fatigued voices.The vocal folds, Dr Nerurkar explains, is in the shape of a ‘V’ roughly in the middle of the larynx and when one speaks, the folds vibrate 100 times in a second in men and 200 in women.While people whose jobs require them to talk a lot are more prone to voice disorders — think singers, teachers, RJs, actors, builders, housewives, and call centre workers — “What distinguishes politicians is that they not only speak loudly and continuously but their speeches are often emotionally charged. Also, they frequently address small gatherings or party meetings without a microphone, which further increases vocal strain,” says Nerurkar, adding that this relentless strain on the mid membrane of the vocal cord, also called the ‘striking zone’, takes its toll resulting in swollen tissues and the arrival of pesky bumps — nodules, polyps, or cysts.Based on a study that Nerurkar had conducted in 2016, politicians tend to fit into a personality type, with an increased chance of developing these vocal disorders. “We discovered a strong correlation between personality type and vocal health, and that the incidence of vocal abuse and subsequent vocal pathologies are heavily governed by the person’s personality traits,” explained Nerurkar.Researchers examined 100 individuals, half with vocal issues and half with healthy vocal cords, analysing personality traits, speech speed, and volume to identify factors causing polyps, nodules, and cysts. Interestingly, it wasn’t speech speed or volume that mattered most, but personality type. “Type A individuals, known for speaking loudly and quickly, were more prone to vocal problems compared to Type B who spoke more softly and slowly. Politicians typically fall into the Type A,” she said.It’s become a familiar sight over the years for audiologist and speech therapist Dr Piyush Gujarathi, to see politicians flocking to him with voice woes. “When their voice takes a hit, politicians tend to get jittery because speech holds immense importance for them. They feel under confident if they’re unable to project their voice.”However, unlike stage performers who are more cautious and aware of their limits, politicians tend to shrug it off as a sore throat, hoping warm water gargles will do the trick. “And typically end up in the doctor’s chamber at an acute stage when severity has peaked.”According to ENT specialist Dr Milind Navalakhe, the development of vocal lesions among politicians is often a gradual process, when an unyielding hoarse voice or sudden bleeding prompts them to seek medical attention.““I’ve seen politicians with polyps and also cases with subepithelial haemorrhage — the bursting of blood vessels beneath the vocal folds,” says Dr Nerurkar who has performed micro laryngeal surgeries on several of them. “I’ve also had politicians come with spasmodic dysphonia where muscles in the voice box go into spasm while talking. We inject botox into the vocal folds for these patients.”Symptoms of vocal cord edema — hoarseness, pain, change of pitch, inability to speak — had crept up slowly, prompting three politicians — Samajwadi’s Rais Shaikh, Bala Nandgaonkar of MNS and Congress’s Neelam Dolas —to finally seek medical help after a month of enduring the discomfort while campaigning for the 2014 assembly elections. The trio were advised 20-day ‘voice rest’ by doctors after they damaged their vocal cords while giving loud speeches and addressing non-stop public meetings.Former Indian cricketer turned Congress leader Navjot Singh Sindhu had a similar experience during the Lok Sabha election in 2019 when he damaged his vocal cords after speaking at 80 political rallies in 28 days. Instead of opting for a soothing balm coating that would force him into four days of silence, he chose anti-inflammatory injections and steroids.“The issue is that they keep at it without much regard for vocal hygiene — forgetting to slow down, sip water in between speeches and resist the urge to shout into the microphone,” says Navalakhe. “In the initial stages, conservative medical management and speech therapy can resolve the issues. Surgery becomes necessary when nodules fail to respond to therapy,” says Navalakhe, who notes that approximately 10 percent of his patients are politicians, many of whom have undergone surgical procedures under his care.But post-op, is where the real challenge is. Patients require at least seven days of voice rest. “And getting them to follow that up with voice therapy is another uphill battle,” says Dr Nerurkar of breaking ingrained vocal habits with proper volume control, speech speed, microphone usage, and relaxation techniques to prevent nodules from reappearing. “Occasionally, I have to be quite firm with them, it’s like guiding someone through a weight loss journey,” says Dr Gujarathi.“I have to often remind them that healing takes time and commitment. The body doesn’t recognise one’s profession or prominence,” says Dr Nerurkar, recounting a case involving a senior politician who came to her with a voice change, and was ultimately diagnosed with a vocal fold polyp.“After undergoing laser excision surgery, I presented him with a ‘voice rest’ badge — a yellow smiley with a crossed-out mouth — that I give all my patients. He was so good at following instructions that he upgraded to a poster on his desk at Mantralaya and pointed at it every time someone tried to make conversation during his recovery. Since then, he’s done well and referred other politicians to me,” says Nerurkar.Because a clear, strong voice could be worth its weight in votes.",World Voice Day on April 16 is dedicated to spotlighting the role vocal cord health plays in our personal and professional lives. Voice surgeon Dr Nupur Nerurkar says she often encounters politicians with “phonotraumatic lesions” or benign growths on the vocal cords due to overuse.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109278191,imgsize-115522,width-400,resizemode-4/109278191.jpg"

The Commission has recommended an impartial investigation into the complaints by central agencies.Noting that the Calcutta High Court is already hearing the Sandeshkhali case, the NHRC will be seeking leave of the HC to intervene in the matter.As per the observations in the report based on a spot visit by a team led by one of its members from the commission between February 23-25 “the atmosphere due to the atrocities by the alleged accused persons rendered the victims silent” and the “intimidation” and “terror created” made them “reluctant to seek justice”.The NHRC emphasised on the need to “reinstate trust in the rule of law and confidence in authorities” and “uproot the fear” of these accused persons from the hearts of the victims. The commission highlights the important role that district authorities have going forward in instilling confidence among residents so that others who have been victims of crimes may come forward and file their complaints.The NHRC has recommended the appointment of special rapporteurs to periodically report on the situation in Sandeshkhali. Some of the other recommendations include - “investigation of missing girls and women from Sandehskhali; ensuring witness protection and redressal of grievances; counseling and rehabilitation of victims of sexual offences; return of the land to the legitimate owners; operationalisation of Nationwide Emergency Response System (NERS).”The enquiry report highlights with much concern that according to data on missing females provided by Police Station Sandeshkhali from January 1,2023 to February 25, as many as 37 young women and 3 minor girls were still untraced. ""This number is alarmingly large and a thorough in-depth investigation is required to trace the victims and to ascertain the reasons for their going missing including the angel of human trafficking,"" the report states. Hence the Commission has recommended that an investigation is necessary into cases of women who have gone missing.The commission has sought an action taken report on its recommendations within eight weeks from the West Bengal govt.According to the report the “The villagers/victims faced assault, threat, sexual exploitation, land grabbing, and forced unpaid labour, and under the given circumstances they were compelled to seek livelihood outside the Sandeshkhali region.”The inquiry also observes that “allegations of deprivation of the right to vote are serious in nature and undermine the democratic values of the nation.”The NHRC statement further highlighted that the inquiry team interacted with the police and administration at Sandeshkhali and requested for further information, ""but despite reminders, no reply has been given to date”.Sheikh Shahjahan - the prime accused facing allegations of land grab and sexual harassment in Sandeshkhali, was arrested on February 29 by the state police. A Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader, Shahjahan, was suspended by the party for six years after his arrest.On February 21, the NHRC, had taken suo motu cognizance of media reports related to the protests and violence in Sandeshkhali. Besides deciding on sending a team to the spot, the Commission also sought a report from the state government. In response to the NHRC notice the DG & IGP, West Bengal on February 29 revealed that a total of 25 cases were registered among which 7 cases were on complaints of alleged sexual offence against women and 24 accused persons were arrested. The state authorities had said that efforts were also being made to arrest the absconding perpetrators of the crime. The overall situation of the entire Sandeshkhali area was described by the state authorities ""to be well under control"".",National Human Rights Commission’s spot inquiry into the violence in Sandeshkhali case has revealed “several instances of atrocities on victims” The Commission has recommended an impartial investigation into the complaints by central agencies.

In the same way, one bullet train will run in North India, one bullet train in South India and one bullet train in Eastern India. Survey work for this will also be started soon,” PM Modi said.The BJP also proposes the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), which would provide a common set of laws governing personal matters for all citizens regardless of religion, gender, or caste. This move would involve repealing existing laws like the Hindu Marriage Act and the Christian Marriage Act to establish a uniform legal framework.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who chaired the Manifesto Committee, highlighted the party's track record of fulfilling past promises and the extensive feedback received from different channels. “I don’t hesitate to say that the BJP manifesto is the gold standard for the political parties in not only India but across the world”, Rajnath Singh said.","The BJP has unveiled its eagerly anticipated manifesto titled 'Modi Ki Guarantee' Sankalp Patra.

Two tiny polling stations to be set up in Telangana for 10 voters each,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-tiny-polling-stations-to-be-set-up-in-telangana-for-10-voters-each/articleshow/109281449.cms,"HYDERABAD: In a bid to demonstrate the importance given to every single vote and accessibility, the Election Commission is setting up two smallest auxiliary polling stations in Telangana 's remote tribal areas which will likely witness only 10 voters each exercising their franchise in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections . In order to ensure that the voters who earlier were forced to trek rugged terrains close to 20 km to cast their votes are spared of the difficulty, officials said the two polling stations will be set up in as many different Lok Sabha segments in the state.Each station will be manned by six election officials, including a volunteer and security personnel.Under Achampet assembly constituency of Nagarkurnool Parliamentary segment, an auxiliary polling station will be set up in a private building in Mallapur 'penta' for 10 voters, which would help them save a 20-km trek for casting vote.Similarly, another auxiliary polling station will be at an Anganwadi centre in Budidgattu in Devarakonda assembly segment under Nalgonda Parliamentary constituency, which too has 10 voters. They earlier had to travel eight km to vote, EC and district administration officials said.Overall, 10 smallest polling stations will be set up in Telangana under Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Mahabubabad Parliamentary segments which have electors numbering between 10 to 26, belonging to STs--Chenchu, Lambadi and Koya tribes, who earlier had to travel a distance ranging from 3 km to 20 km.Seven of the smallest 10 polling stations in the state have been set up in Nagarkurnool District, they said, adding, a polling booth has been created at forest base camp in Sangadigundala for 22 voters, who earlier used to trek 16 km to excercise their franchise. Another polling booth has been set up in a hut in Geesgandi for 23 voters, who earlier travelled 12 km to vote. The voters comprise different families.In Achampet assembly constituency of Nagarkurnool district, there are certain Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) --'Chenchu' families living in deep forest in small groups, Nagarkurnool Collector and District Electoral officer P Udaykumar said.These habitations (penta) consist of anywhere between 2-40 huts far away from mainstream villages and do not have civic amenities like roads.They stay 20-40 km deep inside the forest and due to various limitations earlier, only one polling station used to be established inside the forest for all these habitations forcing them to travel upto 20-30 km for casting vote, he said.""Each habitation is somewhere between 10-15 km away from each other deep inside the forest. At some places the voters had to start in the morning to reach the polling station and after voting in the afternoon they will come back to their own place probably by late evening/night. That was the scenario earlier.""""They had to travel long distances to cast their vote. They had to travel a lot either by walking or if they hired any vehicle like auto-rickshaw it would cost them dearly. We ensured that polling stations are prepared in all the habitats. Now we have established the polling stations within habitation,"" the Collector told PTI.Asked on the arrangements and challenges, the Collector said in few places, the teams carrying poll material have to reach the polling station on foot due to inaccessible locations of the habitations and in some cases, they had to setup polling stations in huts due to lack of permanent structures deep inside the forest, due to forest regulations.On the number of personnel deployed on poll day, officials said each auxiliary polling station has four polling personnel besides police and volunteers.""We have ensured solar power in all the polling stations, drinking water and other facilities. However, it is a challenging thing. In more than 60 per cent of the places there is no communication channels. So we established our own wireless network (VHF radio sets) and we get information about the status of the polling,"" he said.""These auxiliary polling stations are being set up for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group done for the first time. This is an effort for inclusion of marginalised sections--Chenchu groups. These initiatives have been done for enhancing voter turnout also,"" the Collector added.Polling would be held on May 13 for 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state.","The Election Commission is setting up two smallest auxiliary polling stations in Telangana's remote tribal areas. The two polling stations will be set up in as many different Lok Sabha segments in the state. Each station will be manned by six election officials, including a volunteer and security personnel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109281480,imgsize-1355642,width-400,resizemode-4/109281480.jpg"

Fallout from Trump's bid to overturn election loss heads to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fallout-from-trumps-bid-to-overturn-election-loss-heads-to-supreme-court/articleshow/109287527.cms,"IMMUNITY CLAIM

WASHINGTON: The actions of Donald Trump and his supporters following his 2020 election loss top the U.S. Supreme Court 's agenda in the next two weeks in cases involving his bid to avoid prosecution for trying to undo his defeat and an attempt by a man indicted in the Capitol attack to escape a charge that Trump also faces.The two cases assume even greater prominence as Trump campaigns to return to the White House as the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov.5 U.S. election.The justices on Tuesday hear arguments in an appeal by Joseph Fischer, who was indicted on seven charges following the Jan. 6 , 2021, Capitol riot including corruptly obstructing an official proceeding - congressional certification of Biden's victory over Trump. They then hear arguments on April 25 in Trump's assertion of presidential immunity from prosecution.""The court has not yet directly addressed issues related to Jan. 6,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. ""But Fischer and Trump so clearly raise issues arising from Jan. 6.""Trump took numerous steps to try to reverse his 2020 loss. His false claims of widespread voting fraud helped fuel the attack on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Biden's victory. Trump and his allies also devised a plan to use false electors from key states to thwart certification.Federal prosecutors brought obstruction charges against about 350 of the roughly 1,400 people charged in the Capitol attack including Fischer and Trump. A Supreme Court ruling dismissing the charge against Fischer could make it more complicated - but not impossible - to make the charge stick against Trump, according to experts. The charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, though Jan. 6 defendants convicted of obstruction have received far lesser sentences.This is one of four criminal cases against Trump, whose first trial gets underway on Monday in New York on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and called them politically motivated.The Supreme Court on March 4 reversed a ruling by Colorado's top court to exclude Trump from the state's ballot under a constitutional provision involving insurrection. But the justices did not address the lower court's finding that Trump had created ""an atmosphere of political violence"" before the Jan. 6 attack and ""engaged in insurrection.""Until Trump, no former president had faced criminal charges.Trump has asserted that he has ""absolute immunity"" because he was serving as president when he took the actions that triggered Smith's election subversion indictment. Smith has urged the Supreme Court to reject that claim on the principle that ""no person is above the law.""In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case: conspiring to defraud the United States, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.Fischer is awaiting trial on six criminal counts, including assaulting or impeding officers and civil disorder, while he challenges his obstruction charge at the Supreme Court.According to prosecutors, Fischer charged at police officers guarding a Capitol entrance during the attack. Fischer, at the time a member of the North Cornwall Township police in Pennsylvania, got inside and pressed up against an officer's riot shield as police attempted to clear rioters. He remained in the building for four minutes before police pushed him out.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, dismissed Fischer's obstruction charge, ruling that it applies only to defendants who tampered with evidence. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that the law broadly covers ""all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding.""A Supreme Court decision favoring Fischer could mean that hundreds of other defendants who faced the same charge could seek to be re-sentenced, withdraw their guilty pleas or request new trials.""It may not make a lot of practical difference in most cases because if defendants were convicted of multiple charges the judge might decide not to alter the sentence even if the obstruction charge is gone,"" said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the George Washington University Law School.About two-thirds of the Jan. 6 defendants charged with obstruction also were charged with other felonies.Eliason said that a win for Fischer might not deter Smith from pursuing the obstruction charges against Trump, despite the higher bar that the Supreme Court might set.""The charges against Trump can probably survive because Smith will be able to argue that his case did involve evidence-based obstruction, based on the slates of phony electors,"" Eliason said.Legal experts have said the Supreme Court would need to rule by about June 1 for Trump's trial on the election-related charges to finish before Nov. 5. If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself of any federal crimes. Trump has pledged to pardon Jan. 6 defendants.",U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases involving Donald Trump and his supporters following his 2020 election loss. The cases involve his bid to avoid prosecution for trying to undo his defeat and an attempt by a man indicted in the Capitol attack to escape a charge that Trump also faces. The two cases assume even greater prominence as Trump campaigns to return to the White House as the Republican candidate.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109287551,imgsize-41032,width-400,resizemode-4/109287551.jpg"
Former US President Trump backs house speaker Johnson at Mar-a-Lago meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-president-trump-backs-house-speaker-johnson-at-mar-a-lago-meet/articleshow/109269420.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a show of support, former US President Donald Trump stood alongside House Speaker Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago, praising his performance and tempering the far-right forces led by Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene , who are seeking to remove Johnson from office.Trump's endorsement comes as a lifeline for the embattled GOP leader , who has hitched himself and his majority to the indicted Republican Party leader ahead of the November election.Despite some criticism over efforts to oust the speaker, which Trump called ""unfortunate,"" he emphasized that there are ""much bigger problems"" to address, according to an AP report.The visit, arranged as a joint announcement on new House legislation requiring proof of citizenship for voting, holds significance for both parties.Johnson needed Trump to quell hard-line threats against his leadership, while Trump benefits from the imprimatur of official Washington rushing to Florida to embrace his comeback bid for the White House and his entangled election lies.The meeting highlighted the fragility of the speaker's grip on power, just six months into his tenure, but also showcased his evolving understanding of the politics of the Trump era, as Republicans in Congress align with the ""Make America Great Again"" movement fueling the former president's re-election campaign. Both Johnson and Trump employed similar language to describe their campaign strategy, focusing on alarming rhetoric about a ""migrant invasion"" and raising the specter of noncitizens voting, despite it being a federal felony.Kevin McCarthy , the House Speaker, is navigating a delicate balance between supporting former President Donald Trump and advancing his own legislative agenda. McCarthy recognizes that Trump's endorsement is crucial for conducting business in the House, particularly as he seeks to provide US aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.McCarthy is engaging with both the White House and Trump to secure support for the national security package, which is at risk of failing due to Trump's opposition. ""We're looking at it,"" Trump said about the national security package.Meanwhile, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is threatening to call for a snap vote to remove McCarthy from leadership if he allows any US assistance to reach Ukraine.On the matter of election integrity, McCarthy is guiding his House GOP majority to embrace Trump's unfounded claims of a stolen election and setting the stage for potential challenges in the 2024 election. Despite the lack of evidence to support his allegations, Trump maintains that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud, even though every state has certified their results as valid.As Trump campaigns to regain the presidency, he has effectively taken control of the Republican National Committee, aligning the campaign apparatus with his priorities. He endorsed Michael Whatley to lead the RNC, which has established a new ""Election Integrity Division"" and aims to hire thousands of lawyers nationwide.","Former US President Donald Trump stood alongside House Speaker Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago, praising his performance.

Western media questions Indian democracy in string of op-eds on Lok Sabha elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/western-media-questions-indian-democracy-in-string-of-op-eds-on-lok-sabha-elections/articleshow/109276708.cms,"LONDON: Opinion pieces on the Indian elections have been appearing thick and fast in the Western press.On Monday, the Times ran a “leading article” saying: “Mr Modi is likely to be recognised as probably the most significant Indian leader since independence”, putting his popularity down to spectacular growth, new technology, and welfare policies.“Modi has cultivated the image of a strongman… thumbing his nose at Western liberals and telling Indians their turn in the global spotlight has come.This plays as well with the poor as the rich elites,” it said.But “there is a darker side to his popularity,” the editorial continued. “Modi embraces ‘Hindutva”, playing up a nationalist Hinduism and discriminating against and passing laws that “disadvantage India’s large Muslim minority”. It said Modi was “intolerant of the opposition”, referring to the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and claimed that “heavy pressure has been imposed on India’s once lively press to toe the government line,” including occasional harassment of the BBC.The arrest of AAP ministers and freezing of Congress bank accounts have been frequently mentioned.Edward Luce, associate editor at the FT, asked on X: “Will this be India's last democratic election”, whilst Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian’s correspondent, wrote: “Analysts and opponents have warned this could be the most one-sided election in India’s history.”The FT’s editorial board penned an article titled “The ‘mother of democracy’ is not in good shape”, saying: “PM Modi has repeatedly called India the ‘mother of democracy’. If so, an intensifying clampdown on opposition parties suggests this matriarch of representative government is in ill health. Harassment, often by tax or legal authorities, has become common for government critics… The BJP ’s muscular Hindu nationalism has eroded India’s tradition of secular democracy.”Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee wrote that the ""more progressive and successful part of the country"" was ""drifting away from the poverty-ridden north"" and its ""majoritarian leader."" “A Hindu rashtra, or nation-state, will play well in the north. The very prospect of such an outcome fills the south with dread,” he claimed.In the FT, Ruchir Sharma argued that Modi had expanded his base, not because of Hindutva ideology, but because he was delivering economic progress, and that the people of India were prepared to “trade political freedom for perceived progress” in the same way countries such as Taiwan and South Korea put together long runs of rapid growth with low inflation under autocratic leaders.All the op-eds predicted BJP would win the election and Congress faced a wipeout.

Lok Sabha polls: Emerging-market bulls tout Modi premium,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lok-sabha-polls-emerging-market-bulls-tout-modi-premium/articleshow/109282987.cms,"Equity premium

Rupee’s calm

Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , India’s stocks have commanded an unprecedented premium to emerging-market peers. As he seeks a third successive term, investors are betting that the performance can continue.Modi is likely to spend heavily on manufacturing and infrastructure should he win, continuing a strategy that wooed money managers during his decade in power.The stock market has rallied to successive records, while India’s imminent inclusion in a major global bond index is expected to lure billions of dollars in inflows.A “pro-growth, pro-market agenda” is being endorsed by the electorate, said Andrei Stetsenko, a New York-based portfolio manager of Farley Capital. “To a much greater degree than a decade ago, the company managements with whom I meet feel the government is on their side.”Modi’s 10 years in office have ensured political stability and policy continuity, helping reduce extreme swings in asset prices and turning India into a preferred investment destination for global funds. The election will start, in phases, on April 19.When votes are counted on June 4, it will all boil down to whether or not Modi’s party wins a clear majority in the legislature. He has predicted a tally of more than 400 seats for his Bharatiya Janata Party and allies, though it remains to be seen whether the electorate’s top concerns over lack of jobs and high inflation, as highlighted by a recent poll, weigh on his popularity.In 2019, the alliance led by the BJP won more than 350 of the 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament.“Modi has unlocked India’s potential,” said Mike Sell, head of global emerging equities at Alquity Investment Management Ltd. “Investors prefer stability and clarity. A majority government versus an unwieldy coalition would certainly be preferable.”Here is a deeper look at how Indian assets have performed under Modi:The median premium paid by global investors to own Indian shares against buying equities in other EMs jumped to 54% under Modi’s tenure, from 30% during the previous regime led by the Indian National Congress, data compiled by Bloomberg show.In contrast, stocks in China witnessed a median discount of 4% to peers during the last decade, reflecting the diverging fortunes of the world’s two largest emerging markets.In terms of absolute returns, the MSCI India Index’s surge of almost 200% under Modi looks tamer in comparison to the more than 300% rally the index saw in the previous decade.Investor confidence in Indian markets still seems to have grown under Modi, with volatility plummeting across asset classes. For stocks, the median 30-day volatility in the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index dropped to 13 points over the last decade, from 18.5 points in the previous comparable period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“India offers a strong protection on downside in terms of volatility,” said Vivek Dhawan, portfolio manager at Candrium Belgium NV. “In the last two-to-three years, there were a lot of headwinds — geopolitics, interest rates going higher and all that — but that meant India’s appeal due to its low volatility increased.”While the Indian rupee steadily depreciated during Modi’s two terms, volatility in the currency has petered out in recent years, making it a favorite among carry traders.The central bank has kept such a tight grip on the rupee that expected swings based on options prices have fallen the most in the world over the past decade. That’s a big change from the prior 10-year period, when the rupee was one of the most volatile currencies.Currency stability in turn has boosted the attractiveness of the nation’s sovereign debt for foreign investors, with Indian bonds seeing the longest monthly streak of inflows in almost a decade ahead of their inclusion in major global bond indexes.A Bloomberg gauge of India’s benchmark sovereign bonds has given positive returns in all 10 years of Modi’s tenure, and looks set to edge higher if he retains power.“India is defying the EM wisdom of at least one step back for every two steps forward,” Macquarie Group Ltd.’s Viktor Shvets and Kyle Liu wrote in a note dated April 8. “India is likely to continue on its gravity-defying path, with less inflation, stable growth and lower risk premia.”","Modi’s 10 years in office have ensured political stability and policy continuity. The election will start, in phases, on April 19. The median premium paid by global investors to own Indian shares against buying equities in other EMs jumped to 54% under Modi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109283024,imgsize-32908,width-400,resizemode-4/109283024.jpg"

How cap helped cops identify accused

NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in the Bengaluru cafe blast case , NIA on Friday arrested two suspects from Kolkata.Adbul Matheen Taha and Mussavir Hussain Shazeb were apprehended from their hideout near the city.According to NIA, Shazib placed the IED at the cafe while Taha is the mastermind behind the planning, execution of the blast, and subsequent evasion from the law.The accused were hiding under false identities.NIA, Central intelligence agencies, and state police agencies of West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka, and Kerala were involved in the operation.At least 10 people were injured after an IED blast at the famous Whitefield eatery, Rameshwaram Cafe, on March 1.NIA had announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for information about the suspect in the case.The federal agency had also released several visuals of the suspect travelling in various buses in Karnataka.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee during a election rally in Cooch Behar aserted that it was her govt which ensured arrest of two accused in the Bengaluru cafe blast case.Mamata also said that BJP was spreading misinformation about Bengal not being safe.A cap that one of the suspects, Musavir Hussain Shazib, was wearing helped police identify the duo after CCTV images showed their faces before they bought the cap. The accused were spotted in Chennai in January.Soon after the blast NIA had recovered the cap. The Tamil Nadu team found that Shazib and his aide Abdil Mathern Taha had bought the cap from a mall in Mylapore in Chennai and stayed in a lodge at Triplicane.Earlier, investigators had found several pieces of CCTV footage of the suspect, but his face remained covered by the cap.Zooming in on the image, NIA sleuths had noted down the serial number on the cap and tracked it to a shop in the mall that sold it in Jan.","Adbul Matheen Taha and Mussavir Hussain Shazeb were apprehended from their hideout near the city.

Reliance will continue to review options to see how best to represent India globally and offer value to customers leveraging the technology capabilities that we have already operationalized in India,” Oommen said.He said that to truly drive the Digital India vision, the government should start leveraging Rs 75,700 crore Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) not just for mobile tower deployment but to make devices and services affordable and accessible for individuals.He said Jio Bharat Phone ecosystem is an enabler to 2G mukt Bharat and AI Yukt Bharat.He said that the underutilised USO fund should be leveraged for not just telecom infrastructure but also giving help to individuals for devices and services for those who cannot afford the transition.""Anyone who cannot afford connectivity or monthly rent should be given a device and service model by leveraging the fund,” Oommen said.The government at present charges 8 per cent of telecom companies' revenue as licence fee. Out of this, 5 per cent of the collection is earmarked for USOF which is utilised for promoting telecom connectivity in rural and remote areas.Oommen said that the 5 per cent collection for USOF should be removed and licence fees should be reduced to 3 per cent.“Let the telecom industry use those funds for continued investment. Give these as an incentive to the telecom industry to expand and enhance not just connectivity but for adoption of services by the needy to move to 4G and 5G services. There is no rationale to keep the users in the 2G era,” Oommen said.He said that devices are a very critical equation in the adoption of any service.""We brought the most affordable 4G device and the 4G adoption increased. Now the 5G devices are coming in the Rs 10,000 range and we see more and more and more 5G adoption happening. But we need to get this even lower,” Oommen said.He said that it is critical for the telecom industry to take along 240 million 2G users to grow them and connect them with modern networks.When asked about views on sustainability of the industry with current mobile call and data price, Oommen said the industry should ensure including the whole of India under the Digital India programme at the time of deciding on tariff.“Increasing the tariffs is the easiest thing that one can do but having the right tariff that takes all of India together is what I think as an industry we need to continue to embrace. That's how we will get 2G-mukt Bharat. Otherwise, you will leave over 200 million of India behind,” Oommen said.Talking about satellite communication technology, Oommen said the technology has evolved to a level that it will complement other land-based telecom networks.He said that the spectrum allocation methodology for mobile networks and satellites should be the same.“We absolutely believe, since satellite offers the same services, to the same devices, to the same customers with similar standards, why should it be considered any different. There seems to be no logic at all. Anything other than auction of the spectrum will distort the market significantly,” Oommen said.He said that Jio has demonstrated gigabit speed using satellite communications technology which is no different from the speed that can be transmitted on land based networks.","Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said that India is now a tier 1 plus country.

The committee recommended DoT to expand the review committees that review the order of telecom services suspension under the Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. It suggested inclusion of non-official members, such as retired judges, eminent citizens, heads of public organisations, TSP (telecom service provider) etc, to explore the possibility of including local MP and MLA in the review committee.The DoT in its reply said one of the members of the review committee is a law secretary with judicial background and presence of a member with judicial background provides review of the order suspending telecom services with neutral perspective.""The department of telecommunications are also of the opinion that the composition of the review committee is balanced and needs no further modification. The committee finds the above reply of the department very unsatisfactory and the essence of the recommendation has been lost,"" the panel said.The panel report said that the DoT has not conducted any study to assess the impact of internet shutdown on economy.The panel said that it agrees with the view of the department that social media can be misused by anti-social elements. However, frequent shutdown of the internet without any empirical study to prove the effectiveness of internet shutdown in controlling law and order, civic unrest, etc. is a ""matter of great concern"".""The committee are perplexed with the reply of the department and deplore the indifferent attitude of the department to such an important aspect of the subject. The committee, therefore, strongly urge the department that a thorough study be commissioned by the government of India so as to assess the impact of internet shutdown on the economy and also find out its effectiveness in dealing with public emergency and public safety,"" the panel said.The panel said the Supreme Court had ordered that any order suspending the internet issued under the Suspension Rules must adhere to the principle of proportionality. As per the amended Suspension Rules, 2017, any order issued under these rules shall not be in operation for more than 15 days.""Noting that the replies of the DoT and MHA on the principle of proportionality and procedure for lifting the shutdowns are vague and lack clarity, the committee had recommended that the department in co-ordination with the MHA should lay down a clear cut principle of proportionality and procedure for lifting of shutdown,"" the panel said.",The Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology on'Suspension of Telecom Services and Internet and its impact' tabled in Lok Sabha on Thursday.

Indian aviation market has huge potential waiting to be tapped: Top industry experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-aviation-market-has-huge-potential-waiting-to-be-tapped-top-industry-experts/articleshow/101857305.cms,"COLOMBO: India's aviation market has a ""huge potential"" waiting to be tapped, and a growing middle-class and a young population usually showing a greater propensity to travel will contribute to its growth, top experts of the industry have said.Besides, privatisation of airports has been a ""big boost for aviation"", and huge investment is happening in new airports and existing airports in India, said Nipun Aggarwal, Chief Commercial & Transformation Officer, Air India .Aggarwal of Air India, CEO of IndiGo , Pieter Elbers; CEO of SriLankan Airlines, Richard Nuttall and Country Director for the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) in India Amitabh Khosla, were among leaders of the aviation industry who took part in Indian Travel Congress 2023 hosted recently in Colombo, as part of the efforts to boost tourism in the cash-strapped island nation.The industry experts concurred that the growth in the aviation sector will in turn fuel the growth in the tourism sector, both of which were badly hit globally after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but have shown resilience, and are recovering on the right trajectory.""In so far as aviation is concerned, we are extremely bullish on the long-term prospects of the industry. Indian aviation is the third-largest and fastest-growing market in the world, growing at almost 10 per cent for the last decade, almost 2.5 times the global average,"" Aggarwal said.He was speaking in a panel discussion on 'India Tourism Vision 2047: A Transformed Landscape of Experiences and Connections', held as part of the 67th annual convention of the TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) -- Indian Travel Congress -- in the Sri Lankan capital from July 6-9.""Aviation is very closely related to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and GDP per capita... We have a growing middle class, a rapidly urbanising population, and we have a very young population. We are a billion-plus population,"" he said.The top official of Air India underlined that India is the third largest aviation market, but ""our market size is a fraction of the US or China market, so the potential out there is huge"".He said air travel penetration in India is still ""very, very low"", with only ""0.1 trips per capita compared to 0.5 trips per capita in China"", adding, that the Indian government has taken multiple steps over the last decade or so, to facilitate aviation.Also, the way aviation infrastructure is coming up in India is quite commendable, and this is driving supply and driving demand, Aggarwal added.""In times to come, we feel that aviation will grow 5-6 times from where we are. In 2019 we had almost 200 million passengers, and in the next couple of decades, we can easily cross a billion plus. That's not a very difficult target,"" he said.There are ""massive opportunities"" in the vibrant Indian aviation market , the IATA's Director General Willie Walsh had said on the sidelines of the IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Istanbul in June.The disposable income of middle and high-income households is rising much faster than the national average. India is going to have one of the largest young populations in the world, which usually has a greater propensity to travel, India's Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement in March this year.Aggarwal said in Colombo that in terms of the overall market size, aviation has three segments, domestic, short-haul and long-haul, and ""we have been primarily operating in domestic and short-haul, as a country"".""We are not even scratching the surface when it comes to market share on long-haul. Out of 200 million people flying in and out of India, 20 million are long-haul... So, there is a huge potential out there waiting to be tapped,"" he added.With the privatisation of Air India, now it has ""enabled the Indian aviation"" to tap a very, very large segment of the market that had hitherto ""remained untapped"", the senior official of Air India said.Union Minister of Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia, in his address at an aviation summit in Delhi in March, had underlined the scope of exponential growth and said that India is the third-largest domestic market in the world in terms of seat capacity, but in terms of international seat capacity, we are still ranked at the 18th position. Therefore, the prospect for long-term consistent growth in the market seems very strong, the ministry had said.IndiGo's CEO Elbers asserted that there is ""enormous potential"" in building traffic in the region, and mentioned its new flights that are set to begin operations soon from India (Mumbai) to Jakarta, Indonesia and Nairobi, Kenya.""Let's work together to ensure that Indian aviation grows as we move into the future,"" he said in his address during a session held as part of the TAAI convention.The top boss of IndiGo recalled the recent historic order of 500 aircraft made by the no-frills airline that started flying more than 16 years ago. The budget carrier in June had placed a firm order for 500 narrow-body planes with Airbus. This is the largest ever single aircraft order placed by any airline with Airbus.Currently, IndiGo operates more than 300 aircraft and has plans to double its fleet by the end of this decade.In another panel discussion on 'Sky is not the Limit' held as part of the TAAI convention, Country Director for the IATA in India, Khosla, said, ""In the long-term passenger forecast for IATA, we see, India, in this decade... will be the third largest global aviation market, which is a significant milestone. Needs to be repeated over and over again, because that is where we are headed"".If one sees the top 10 charts of how countries fare in terms of travel market size, six of them are in Asia, and it's also growth for the entire region, he said.In the story of growth, ""we don't see any roadblock, even though there are short-term blockers of infrastructure and supply, or supply chain not able to cope up. Workforce leaving the industry during pandemic years, supply chain issues. Regardless of that, we are seeing India on a growth trajectory,"" Khosla said.SriLankan Airlines CEO, Nuttall said, the opportunities for Sri Lanka in the aviation sector are ""massive"".""We are trying to get back to where we were in pre-Covid time, in the next 12-18 months. We are building a new terminal, the current airport is already constrained. Work on the new terminal that had stopped last year has now restarted.Hopefully, in the next couple of years, we will have a new terminal, double the size of what we have today,"" he said.","India's aviation market has a ""huge potential"" waiting to be tapped, experts of the industry have said.

Interim Budget 2024: National Pension System Update and Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-2024-national-pension-system-update-and-details/articleshow/106926120.cms,"Budget 2024 : The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS ). The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme, is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.According to an ET report, the committee has explored certain adjustments and assurances during its discussions.However, the members are reluctant to increase the financial burden or revert to the old pension scheme , as per the mentioned sources. The government may opt for public consultations before making any decisions.""The fine print is being worked out,"" one of the officials told the financial daily. The report will center on improving the NPS while addressing concerns from some pensioners compared to the old pension scheme (OPS).""The report will not be prescriptive and any changes, if at all required, will be weighed against the fiscal impact and it will be then put for the public consultation,"" the official further added.In April of the previous year, the government established a committee to examine the matter of pensions within the NPS for government employees. The committee's mandate was to propose solutions for enhancing NPS pension benefits while taking fiscal considerations into account.The National Pension System has been applied to all central government employees who joined on or after January 1, 2004, excluding those in the armed forces. As per the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), with the exception of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, all state governments have notified and implemented the NPS for their employees.The controversy surrounding the NPS intensified last year when states governed by the Congress party, including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Himachal Pradesh, opted to return to the previous defined benefit system. Under this system, government employees were entitled to receive 50% of their last-drawn salary as a monthly pension. In contrast, the NPS operates as a defined contribution scheme, where employees build a retirement corpus. It is noteworthy that Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have since transitioned to BJP-led governments.The opposition argues that state government employees shouldn't depend on the unpredictable stock market where NPS funds are invested. States that returned to the old pension system also requested a refund of the accumulated NPS corpus, but the government rejected it, stating it's not possible under current laws.The government has said that the old pension scheme is not financially viable because it continually increases the burden on the treasury, which is why it was discontinued.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and numerous economists have voiced opposition to reinstating the old pension scheme. They argue that such a decision would disrupt the fiscal equilibrium of the states.Last month, the government informed the Rajya Sabha that there is currently no proposal being considered for the reinstatement of the old pension scheme (OPS) for central government employees.","The February 1 interim budget is likely to give an update on the National Pension System ( NPS) The team, led by finance secretary TV Somanathan, reviewing the scheme is expected to submit its report by the end of this month.

Pak also mentioned that the wearable may also include an interactive cognitive alertness test that can help wearers understand if their score is accurate.Apart from this, sleep tracking is also expected to be a big area of focus for the Galaxy Ring as it will be easier to wear while sleeping.
