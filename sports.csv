NEW DELHI: Sitting comfortably at the third spot in the IPL 2024 standings with six points, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have clinched three victories, two of which were secured on their home ground.Their next challenge lies in defeating a struggling Delhi Capitals , currently at the bottom of the table with just one win out of five matches. Despite their solid performance, LSG face concerns in their pace department, with young sensation Mayank Yadav possibly sidelined due to an abdominal issue for the upcoming match.However, even in the absence of key players like Mayank and Mohsin Khan, LSG displayed resilience in their recent encounter against Gujarat Titans, with Yash Thakur's superb bowling securing victory. In the spin department, Krunal Pandya and Ravi Bishnoi have been standout performers. Although skipper KL Rahul's batting form has been inconsistent, his leadership remains crucial. Star batters Quinton de Kock and Nicholas Pooran have been in fine touch, while Ayush Badoni and Devdutt Padikkal are yet to shine.Meanwhile, Delhi Capitals are grappling with injuries to key players like Mitchell Marsh and Kuldeep Yadav, further complicating their campaign. Despite relying on pacers Khaleel Ahmed and Ishant Sharma, DC's bowling lineup has struggled for consistency, compounded by Anrich Nortje's ongoing rustiness post-injury.Over the last two seasons, Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals clashed three times, with LSG boasting an unblemished record against DC, winning all three encounters. The head-to-head tally stands at 3-0 in favor of LSG, showcasing their dominance over DC in recent matchups.Last season, LSG secured a significant victory against Delhi Capitals, largely credited to Mark Wood's pivotal performance for Rahul's squad. Despite Warner and Shaw's explosive start, reaching 40/0 in just four overs, Wood's consecutive breakthroughs disrupted Delhi's momentum.With efforts from Warner to stabilize going in vain, Lucknow's imposing target of 193 remained insurmountable. Kyle Mayers and Nicholas Pooran's contributions were instrumental in propelling Lucknow to a formidable total in the first innings.In the last five matches at Lucknow's Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, the chasing team has emerged victorious each time. This trend indicates that the toss-winning captain in the upcoming match will likely opt to field first. In IPL 2024, the stadium has hosted only two matches, both won by LSG with a margin of over 20 runs.The Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow boasts two distinct types of pitches: red soil and black soil pitches. These varying soil compositions offer diverse playing conditions, influencing the behavior of the ball and the strategies employed by players. Teams need to adapt their game plans accordingly, making the stadium a unique and challenging venue for cricket matches.In Lucknow's Ekana Cricket Stadium, slow bowlers often find favour due to the pitches' tendency to offer low and slow deliveries. Players like Ravi Bishnoi and Kuldeep Yadav are expected to thrive in such conditions. However, teams batting first typically hold the advantage, suggesting that setting a target may be key to securing victory at the venue.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (c) (wk), Deepak Hooda/Devdutt Padikkal, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran, Krunal Pandya, Ayush Badoni, Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Yash Thakur, Yudhvir Singh.Prithvi Shaw, David Warner , Rishabh Pant (c) (wk), Abishek Porel, Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel, Kumar Kushagra, Kuldeep Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, Anrich Nortje.Wicketkeepers: Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh PantBatters: Prithvi Shaw, David WarnerAll-rounders: Axar Patel, Marcus StoinisBowlers: Ravi Bishnoi, Naveen-ul-Haq, Anrich NortjeCaptain: David WarnerVice-captain: Axar PatelAs the captain of the team, Rahul's leadership and batting prowess will be instrumental in guiding LSG to victory against DC. Known for his consistency and ability to anchor the innings, Rahul's performance will play a crucial role in setting up a competitive total or chasing down the opposition's score. The Indian international has scored 126 runs in four matches.Having amassed 126 runs in four matches, Nicholas Pooran emerges as a pivotal player for LSG. Pooran's explosive batting style and ability to score quick runs make him a formidable force in the middle order. With his capability to change the course of the game with aggressive strokes, Pooran's performance will be crucial in setting up a challenging total or accelerating the run rate during crucial phases of the match.Warner's vast experience, formidable batting technique, and knack for scoring big runs make him a vital asset at the top of the order. Partnering with Prithvi Shaw, he could anchor the innings while also accelerating the scoring rate when needed. Moreover, Warner's leadership qualities and strategic insights on the field add depth to DC's gameplay, making him a pivotal figure in their quest for victory against LSG.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) are currently third in the IPL 2024 standings. Delhi Capitals (DC) are bottom of the table with just one win out of five matches. LSG face concerns in their pace department, with young sensation Mayank Yadav possibly sidelined.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109236785,imgsize-81952,width-400,resizemode-4/109236785.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are synonymous to each other in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Virat has played for RCB since IPL 's inaugural season in 2008 and stuck to it.Virat has been the captain of RCB for several seasons, bringing his aggressive and passionate style of leadership to the team. Under his captaincy, RCB has seen both highs and lows, including reaching the IPL finals in 2016.But Kohli has stuck with the team even though RCB still haven't won the IPL trophy.In a viral video, Kohli explains in a podcast what RCB means to him and why he has not joined any other team.The host asks, ""Virat I know you love RCB just as much as RCB loves you. Even for a moment, for a second, while playing this IPL, have you ever wondered is the grass greener on the other side?""Virat answers, ""To be very honest I have thought about it, yes I won't shy away from it and I've been approached many times as well to come into the auction somehow, put my name in there and stuff. And then I thought about it I was like at the end of the day everyone has X number of years they live right and then you die and then life moves on. And there would have been many great people who want trophies and this that blah blah blah but no one addresses you in the room like ""Oh he's an IPL champion"" or ""he's a World Cup champion"".""And it's like if you're a good person, people like you and if you're a bad guy, they stay away from you and eventually that's what life is all about so for me the understanding that the loyalty with RCB is like how I follow my life is far greater for me than the fact that yes five people in the room would say, ""Oh finally you've won the IPL with whoever XYZ and yeah you feel good for five minutes but then the sixth minute you could be miserable with some other issue in life, so it is not the end of the world for me,"" Kohli adds.Kohli goes on to say, ""What this franchise (RCB) has given me in terms of opportunity in the first three years and believed in me, that is the most special thing because as I said there were many teams who had the opportunity but they didn't back me, they didn't believe in me so now when I'm successful and I should fall to the opinion of people saying ""but the IPL"". This was the case with me till 2018 England tour happened. For four years of my life I was doing well everywhere in the world, the only thing was but ""England"". So there's always going to be buts, you literally can't live your life like that and I just carry on my own thing and I actually honestly don't even bother about a third person beyond myself, Anushka discussing things and just being true to ourselves. And that's it for me, nothing else and no one else's opinion matters at all.""Overall, Virat Kohli's journey with RCB has been marked by exceptional batting displays, leadership challenges, and a strong connection with the team's fan base, making him a central figure in the franchise's history.Despite Kohli's individual brilliance, RCB has often struggled to clinch the IPL title. They have reached the playoffs on multiple occasions but have faced challenges in converting those opportunities into championships.Unlike many other players who have switched teams over the years, Kohli has remained loyal to RCB throughout his IPL career. His commitment to the franchise has made him a beloved figure among RCB fans.Kohli's personal achievements, including multiple centuries and accolades like the Orange Cap , highlight his impact on the team.","Virat Kohli has played for Royal Challengers Bengaluru since IPL's inaugural season in 2008.

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav 's childhood coach Kapil Dev Pandey disclosed on Sunday that he had advised the Indian spinner against hastening his return to the field to ""impress anyone,"" emphasizing the importance of being ""100% fit"" before taking the ground for Delhi Capitals in the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).Following a three-match absence due to a groin injury, Kuldeep made his comeback for Delhi Capitals, capturing three crucial wickets while conceding just 20 runs against Lucknow Super Giants.His stellar performance was instrumental in Delhi's crucial victory.""Yes, I spoke to him, I asked him why he was not playing the match and he said that he was injured. I said don't play until you are fit, this was my advice. Often players become emotional in the pursuit of a match or in the pursuit of taking the franchise higher. Josh mein hosh nahi khona... So, I said to play only when you are fit.""Because at this time Kuldeep cannot play just for himself or for any franchise... It is more important to play for the country.

So, he played that match in which he bowled brilliantly,"" Kapil Dev Pandey told IANS.The coach added that with the T20 World Cup in mind, Kuldeep incorporated some changes, including adding variations, to his bowling repertoire.""Injuries keep happening in the long process.

Despite this, Shimron Hetmyer 's cool-headed innings, backed by Rovman Powell 's timely contributions, guided RR to victory and maintained their top spot on the points table.""I thought that Rajasthan had left a little bit too much to do towards the back end.

NEW DELHI: West Indies batting legend Brian Lara praised Mumbai Indians (MI) batsman Suryakumar Yadav for his outstanding batting after returning from an injury layoff as they square off against Chennai Super Kings in the IPL 2024 'El Clasico' on Sunday night.While offering his thoughts on the upcoming match between CSK spinner Ravindra Jadeja and Yadav, Lara began by praising the Chennai spinner for his extraordinary abilities, pointing out that in most games, he would depend on slower balls.Speaking on Star Sports Cricket Live, the former West Indies cricketer said, ""Yeah, it's a battle, but you know, okay, those are some stats that you pull out. I mean, those are the times when he may have failed, but this guy is in superb form. And I mean, if he wants to succumb to that and say, okay, I'm going to rematch against you later. I've got other guys I can take on. He can do that as well.""""But I believe that the confidence that he's in, whether it's left arm spin or left arm pace, whatever you call it, I think he's going to drop the slower balls for most battles. And when you have to actually put pace on the ball, it's always dicey. You like pace on the ball where you can carve it in different directions,"" he said.The West Indian also highlighted the expectation of an interesting fight from Suryakumar, suggesting that it would be one to keep an eye on.After a protracted absence due to an ankle injury and sports hernia surgery, Suryakumar rejoined the Mumbai team for the game against Delhi Capitals but was out for a duck. Suryakumar had missed the first three games for MI.However, the batsman was back to his best in the subsequent match against the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), smashing a 19-ball 52 to tie the MI record for the second-fastest fifty.After the 33-year-old hitter returned from a long injury layoff, Lara was amazed by his performance and said he had never seen shots like that from someone who was just returning from injury.""But what I saw a couple of days ago from Suryakumar Yadav is just genius. I think, I've not seen shots like that from a guy who's just coming off an injury, coming off a first-half attack, or at least a zero in the last game. Tremendous. And I think whatever battle will come from Suryakumar Yadav,"" added Lara.","Brian Lara praised Mumbai Indians batsman Suryakumar Yadav for his outstanding batting after returning from an injury layoff.

NEW DELHI: Travis Head 's career graph saw a slight uptick in 2023, but the Australian batter is aware that maintaining that level will be difficult, and the forthcoming T20 World Cup will be his first stop on that trip.Head's hundreds in two of the biggest cricketing occasions last year - the WTC final and the 50-over World Cup summit clash - were Australia's guiding force against India.However, the 30-year-old now hopes that his time in the Indian Premier League would help him be at his best for the World Cup.""I've come a long way as a player. I guess owning a little bit of the style I want to play and the way I have played overseas too, I've been able to tick a few boxes. Now, the pressure is to continue to play the way I am playing,"" Head told PTI in Bengaluru.""I think in all formats, I need to make sure that I go back to what simplifies everything, which is my technique and my blueprint,"" he added.In the current IPL , Head demonstrated his ability to adjust while playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad As an opener, Head made 133 runs from five matches while striking at 177, giving SRH early momentum and also underscoring his readiness for a hectic T20 role for his country.""With the World Cup coming around the corner and, hopefully, being involved in that squad and batting at the top of the order…it gives me good preparation here in the IPL to try and get some runs and have a little bit of form going into the World Cup,"" noted Head.But playing a full season of IPL could lead to burnout ahead of the ICC marquee event in June.Head was aware of it.

So, a lot of different feelings coming back and not trying to be too nervous or worried about results. I am just making sure that the things that I've done over the last few years are going to work and I best prepare myself to play well for the franchise,"" he said.However, Head admitted that the presence of Pat Cummins (captain) and Daniel Vettori (head coach) in the SRH dressing room eased him into the new environment.""Definitely having Pat and Dan, who I've worked closely with for Australia in the last few years, has helped me. It's a very relaxed environment.""Soon as I got my contract, I knew that I had the backing from those guys and they've confidence in my game,"" he said.Head describes the World Cup final in Ahmedabad as the greatest highlight of his career. With a brilliant century of 120 balls, the left-hander led Australia to win by six wickets and their sixth ODI World Cup.""I think the World Cup final was probably the biggest match of my career, regardless of whether I got runs or not. It was a huge moment. Obviously, I have not played in a World Cup before.""So, to have all the stuff that happened, making it to a final and then being able to contribute in the final makes it all so much better,"" he explained.In addition to scoring a 90 at Ahmedabad and a few 40s at New Delhi and Indore during the 2023 Test series, Head said that this performance laid the groundwork for his resounding victory over India.""The two finals come to mind. But a big Test series (2023) and some T20 games in between…I feel I drew a lot of my blueprint and confidence from that Test tour in India, which then flowed into the World Test Championship and then especially to the World Cup final.""I was able to draw back on some of the things that worked well on those wickets and it's nice that it has come together in big games for me,"" Head offered.Head thought that his assured demeanor resonated perfectly in the Hyderabad team's changing room during the current IPL.""We want to be aggressive and I think we've shown that in the first five games. It suited me as well. I feel, at the moment, we're being really aggressive in the right way and the right moments.""Obviously, Power Play is very important for us and hopefully Abhi (Abhishek Sharma) and I can continue to do what we've been doing in the Power Play,"" he signed off.",Travis Head hopes his time in the Indian Premier League would help him be at his best for the World Cup.

But in search of gaining some lost momentum going into the all-important playoffs, the Juggernauts suffered another rude jolt while hosts NorthEast United restored their pride in the last outing of the season with a clinical 3-0 win at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium .Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach and Phalguni Singh scored one apiece inside the first 45 minutes to make it a memorable night for the Highlanders, who finished best among the ones finishing outside the top-six with playoff spots.Odisha, fighting for the League Shield only a couple of weeks ago, looked a shadow of their dominant self at the Highlanders’ home. Sergio Lobera , suspended for the match, could do nothing but look at his wards’ performance from the stands in disbelief. Resting some of their first-team players in the starting XI and taking the overseas trio of Roy Krishna , Ahmed Jahouh and Mortada Fall off at the half-time, the Kalinga Warriors were lacklustre throughout the 90 minutes to say the least.It looks like the long break due to the FIFA international window could not soothe their nerves following their AFC Cup Inter-zonal two-leg semifinal defeat to Central Coast Mariners about a month ago.In the 12th minute, Gogoi brought up a poacher’s goal from a fast counter-attack to give the hosts a deserving lead. The young Assamese striker placed his left-footed shot from centre of the box at bottom left corner following an assist by winger Jithin MS from left.Before the Kalinga Warriors could regroup, NorthEast doubled the lead four minutes later through Albiach’s clinical finish. Upon receiving a through from Gogoi outside the area, the Spanish attacking midfielder first forced centre-back Thoiba Moirangthem to be wrong footed near the centre of the box and then rounded off an onrushing Odisha goalkeeper Lalthuammawia Ralte before placing home a slow right-footed grounder near right post.Odisha, despite enjoying a larger share of possession, failed to convert that into meaningful forays into the opponents’ area. Their first real chance of reducing the margin went begging in the 25th minute when Krishna failed to convert from the spot. It was Krishna’s first penalty miss in ISL. The Fijian striker has converted from all his previous 10 spot kicks in the country’s top-tier league.Odisha winger Pranjal Bhumij had earned the penalty when he was brought down inside the box. But the former Bengaluru FC forward’s weak, low kick didn’t have enough power to beat NEUFC goalkeeper Mirshad Michu to his right.With nothing going in their favour on the night, the Juggernauts suffered another setback on the cusp of half-time when Phalguni wrote his name on the scoresheet three minutes into the first-half stoppage time.Phalguni was at the right place at the right time when Gogoi’s cross from right found him running at the centre of the box. With Odisha centre-back Fall towering over him, the diminutive Manipuri midfielder shook the net with his right-footed shot at the top right corner to send the Highlanders Brigade into a frenzy.","Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach and Phalguni Singh scored one apiece inside the first 45 minutes to make it a memorable night for the Highlanders.

It was about earning the promotion to the Indian Super League in their own right.No wonder that the noise was the loudest when Zodingliana Ralte, Samad Ali Mallick and Joseph Adjei — all of whom had led the side in the season — hopped on to the dais to receive the trophy fromAIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.That’s the prize the black-and-white brigade has been craving since they suffered the humiliation of relegation from the 2013-2014 season of I-League. A decade later, as they lifted the trophy, they would now be looking for bigger pastures.“We have finished one part of the journey today. We are about to begin another in the ISL with a bigger challenge and a bigger responsibility,” team manager Dipendu Biswas said.Mohammedan Sporting would be the third team from Kolkata to join the ISL bandwagon after Mohun Bagan SG and East Bengal FC.With the I-League title already sealed following the 1-2 win at Lajong FC a week earlier, Mohammedan Sporting’s Russian coach Andrey Chernyshov rested several of his first-team players on Saturday.But Delhi under former Mohammedan Sporting coach Yan Law turned out to be party poopers exposing the home team’s new-look defence to attacking in numbers and punished them with two quick goals.First, an unchallenged Kholmurodov headed in Pape Gassama’s corner and 18-year-old Goyary latched on to Bhupinder Singh’s through ball to beat goalkeeper Biaka Jongte, standing in place of regular Padam Chhetri, with consummate ease.Although Chernyshov introduced regulars like Beneston Barreto, David Hmar and Sheikh Faiaz after the break, the damage was already done and it was not enough to change the script.The upset result came hours after Real Kashmir suffered their biggest loss at home this term, going down 1-4 to Namdhari FC.Two Manipur teams — Neroca FC and TRAU — finished at the bottom two and were subsequently relegated.","Mohammedan Sporting suffer surprise 1-3 loss to Delhi FC.
